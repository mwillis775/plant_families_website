                <h2>The APG IV Classification System</h2>
                <p>This website uses the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group IV (APG IV) classification system, which is the most current and widely accepted system for organizing flowering plants based on their evolutionary relationships.</p>
                <h3>What is APG IV?</h3>
                <p>The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) is an international group of systematic botanists who collaborate to establish a consensus on the taxonomy of flowering plants (angiosperms) based on phylogenetic data. The APG IV system, published in 2016, is the fourth iteration of their classification system.</p>
                <p>Unlike traditional classification systems that relied heavily on morphological similarities, the APG system is based primarily on genetic evidence, particularly DNA sequences. This approach provides a more accurate representation of evolutionary relationships between plant groups.</p>
                <h3>Key Features of APG IV</h3>
                <p>The APG IV system organizes flowering plants into the following major groups:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Angiosperms</strong> (flowering plants) - The largest group of land plants</li>
                    <li><strong>Amborellales</strong> - The most basal lineage of extant angiosperms</li>
                    <li><strong>Nymphaeales</strong> - Water lilies and related plants</li>
                    <li><strong>Austrobaileyales</strong> - A small group of woody plants</li>
                    <li><strong>Magnoliids:</strong> - An ancient lineage including magnolias, laurels, and black pepper</li>
                    <li><strong>Monocots</strong> - Plants with a single seed leaf, including grasses, orchids, and palms</li>
                    <li><strong>Eudicots</strong> - Plants with two seed leaves, including most familiar flowering plants</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Within these major groups, plants are further organized into orders and families based on their evolutionary relationships.</p>
                <h3>Changes in APG IV</h3>
                <p>The APG IV system introduced several changes from previous classifications, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognition of additional orders and families</li>
                    <li>Merging of some previously separate families</li>
                    <li>Refinement of relationships between major plant groups</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These changes reflect ongoing research in plant systematics and our evolving understanding of plant evolution.</p>
