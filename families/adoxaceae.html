<h1>Adoxaceae</h1>
<p class="family-common-name">Moschatel Family / Elderberry Family</p>
<p class="family-description">The Adoxaceae family, commonly known as the Moschatel or Elderberry family, comprises a relatively small group of flowering plants, consisting of five genera and about 200 species. This family includes familiar shrubs like elderberries (<em>Sambucus</em>) and viburnums (<em>Viburnum</em>), as well as the small, unassuming herbaceous plant moschatel (<em>Adoxa</em>).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Adoxaceae includes mostly shrubs and small trees, but also encompasses a few perennial herbs. The family has a predominantly temperate distribution, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, but extending into tropical montane regions and South America. Historically, the genera <i>Sambucus</i> and <i>Viburnum</i> were often placed in the Caprifoliaceae (Honeysuckle family), but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown they form a distinct clade with <i>Adoxa</i>, <i>Sinadoxa</i>, and <i>Tetradoxa</i>.</p>
<p>Members of Adoxaceae are characterized by opposite leaves, which are often compound (<i>Sambucus</i>, <i>Adoxa</i>) or simple (<i>Viburnum</i>). The flowers are typically small, radially symmetric (actinomorphic), and arranged in cymose inflorescences, often forming flat-topped clusters (corymbs or umbel-like cymes) or panicles. The fruit is typically a drupe.</p>
<p>Several species within Adoxaceae are economically and ecologically important. Elderberries (<i>Sambucus</i>) are cultivated for their edible fruits (used in jams, wines, and cordials) and flowers (used for teas and flavorings), as well as for medicinal purposes. Viburnums are widely grown as ornamental shrubs for their attractive flowers and foliage. <i>Adoxa moschatellina</i> (Moschatel) is a less conspicuous forest floor herb known for its unique cube-like inflorescence structure.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>The family includes shrubs and small trees (most <i>Viburnum</i> and <i>Sambucus</i> species) as well as perennial herbs with rhizomes (<i>Adoxa</i>, <i>Sinadoxa</i>, <i>Tetradoxa</i>). Stems are typically solid, although <i>Sambucus</i> often has stems with a large pith.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are almost always arranged oppositely on the stem. They can be simple and entire, toothed, or lobed (<i>Viburnum</i>), or compound (pinnately compound in <i>Sambucus</i>, ternately compound in <i>Adoxa</i>). Stipules are present in <i>Sambucus</i> (sometimes reduced to glands) but usually absent in <i>Viburnum</i> and <i>Adoxa</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Flowers are typically borne in terminal or axillary cymose inflorescences. These are often arranged into dense, flat-topped clusters resembling umbels or corymbs (<i>Sambucus</i>, many <i>Viburnum</i>) or sometimes panicles. In <i>Adoxa</i>, the inflorescence is a unique terminal head with typically five flowers (one terminal, four lateral). Some <i>Viburnum</i> species have showy, sterile marginal flowers surrounding fertile inner flowers (e.g., <i>Viburnum opulus</i>).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are generally small, actinomorphic (radially symmetric), and usually bisexual. Key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Small, with 3-5 fused sepals forming short lobes.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Typically rotate (wheel-shaped) or campanulate (bell-shaped), with 3-5 fused petals. Usually white, cream, or pinkish.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Usually 5 stamens (sometimes 3 or 4 in <i>Adoxa</i>), alternate with the corolla lobes, attached to the corolla tube. Anthers open by longitudinal slits.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> An inferior or semi-inferior ovary, composed of 3-5 fused carpels, but often with only one ovule developing. The style is short or absent, with 3-5 stigmas.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is a drupe or drupe-like berry containing 1-5 pits (pyrenes), each derived from a carpel and typically containing a single seed. Fruits are often brightly colored (red, blue, black) and fleshy, aiding in dispersal by birds.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Members of the family often contain iridoids, saponins, and cyanogenic glycosides (especially in <i>Sambucus</i>, requiring cooking of berries). Tannins are also common. Some species have characteristic scents; <i>Adoxa</i> flowers have a musky scent, contributing to its common name.</p>

<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying members of Adoxaceae often involves observing habit, leaf arrangement and type, and inflorescence structure. Here are key features to look for:</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposite Leaves:</strong> This is a consistent feature across the family. Check the point where leaves attach to the stem.</li>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Determine if the plant is a shrub/small tree (<i>Viburnum</i>, <i>Sambucus</i>) or a small perennial herb (<i>Adoxa</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Inflorescence Type:</strong> Look for flat-topped or rounded clusters (cymes, often umbel-like) of small flowers. <i>Adoxa</i> has a distinctive terminal head.</li>
<li><strong>Flower Structure:</strong> Small, radially symmetric flowers with 3-5 petals and typically 5 stamens. Ovary is inferior or semi-inferior.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit Type:</strong> Look for fleshy drupes, often brightly colored when mature.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leaf Complexity:</strong> Check if leaves are simple (<i>Viburnum</i>) or compound (<i>Sambucus</i>, <i>Adoxa</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Stipules:</strong> Presence (often small or gland-like) in <i>Sambucus</i>, generally absent in <i>Viburnum</i> and <i>Adoxa</i>.</li>
<li><strong>Stem Pith:</strong> <i>Sambucus</i> stems often have a large, soft central pith.</li>
<li><strong>Sterile Marginal Flowers:</strong> Some <i>Viburnum</i> species have enlarged, sterile flowers around the edge of the inflorescence.</li>
<li><strong>Scent:</strong> Crushed leaves of some <i>Sambucus</i> species have an unpleasant odor. <i>Adoxa</i> flowers have a musky scent.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spring:</strong> <i>Adoxa</i> flowers early. Look for emerging leaves and flower buds on shrubs.</li>
<li><strong>Late Spring/Summer:</strong> Peak flowering time for most <i>Sambucus</i> and <i>Viburnum</i> species. Observe flower structure and inflorescence shape.</li>
<li><strong>Late Summer/Fall:</strong> Fruits mature, providing key identification clues (color, size, arrangement). Leaf shape and arrangement are still visible. Some <i>Viburnum</i> species have notable fall foliage color.</li>
<li><strong>Winter:</strong> Opposite branching pattern, persistent fruit clusters (on some), and bud characteristics can help identify woody species.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Caprifoliaceae (Honeysuckle Family):</strong> Many honeysuckles (<i>Lonicera</i>) also have opposite leaves and sometimes similar flower shapes, but often have tubular corollas and true berries (not drupes). Historically, <i>Sambucus</i> and <i>Viburnum</i> were placed here.</li>
<li><strong>Cornaceae (Dogwood Family):</strong> Dogwoods (<i>Cornus</i>) also have opposite leaves (mostly) and often cymose inflorescences. Flower structure differs (usually 4 petals, distinct styles), and fruits are drupes but often clustered differently. Leaf venation (arcuate veins) is often distinctive in <i>Cornus</i>.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrangeaceae (Hydrangea Family):</strong> Some hydrangeas have opposite leaves and large flower clusters, sometimes with sterile marginal flowers like some <i>Viburnum</i>, but flower details (e.g., number of parts, ovary position) and fruit type (capsule) differ.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Adoxaceae belongs to the order Dipsacales within the asterid clade of eudicots. The circumscription of the family has changed significantly with the advent of molecular phylogenetics. Previously, <i>Adoxa</i> was often placed in its own monotypic family (Adoxaceae sensu stricto), while <i>Sambucus</i> and <i>Viburnum</i> were usually included in Caprifoliaceae.</p>
<p>Molecular data strongly supported grouping these three genera, along with the rare Asian genera <i>Sinadoxa</i> and <i>Tetradoxa</i>, into an expanded Adoxaceae (sometimes referred to as Adoxaceae sensu lato). This revised family is now recognized by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) system. <i>Viburnum</i> is sister to the rest of the family, which then splits into a clade containing <i>Sambucus</i> and another containing <i>Adoxa</i>, <i>Sinadoxa</i>, and <i>Tetradoxa</i>.</p>

<h3>Related Families</h3>
<p>Adoxaceae is part of the Dipsacales order, which also includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Caprifoliaceae</strong> (Honeysuckle family): The sister group to Adoxaceae. This family, also redefined by APG, now includes familiar groups like honeysuckles (<i>Lonicera</i>), snowberries (<i>Symphoricarpos</i>), valerians (<i>Valeriana</i>), and teasels (<i>Dipsacus</i>). Distinguished generally by features like more frequently zygomorphic flowers, different fruit types (berries, capsules, achenes), and different stigma characteristics.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>The recognition of Adoxaceae highlights the power of molecular data in resolving phylogenetic relationships that were ambiguous based solely on morphology. The family represents a relatively small lineage within Dipsacales, characterized by predominantly actinomorphic flowers, inferior/semi-inferior ovaries, and drupaceous fruits. Key evolutionary trends within the family include the diversification of growth forms (herb to shrub/tree) and leaf types (simple to compound), as well as variations in inflorescence structure, including the development of sterile marginal flowers in some <i>Viburnum</i> species to enhance pollinator attraction.</p>
