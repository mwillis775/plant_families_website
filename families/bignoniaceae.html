<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Bignoniaceae family, often called the Trumpet Creeper family, encompasses around 800-850 species primarily found in tropical regions worldwide, with the greatest diversity in the Neotropics (tropical Americas). Members are mostly woody plants, famously including spectacular flowering trees (<i>Jacaranda</i>, <i>Tabebuia</i>, <i>Catalpa</i>), shrubs (<i>Tecoma</i>), and a large number of highly successful woody vines or <b>lianas</b> (<i>Campsis</i>, <i>Bignonia</i>, <i>Pyrostegia</i>). These lianas often possess specialized climbing structures, such as tendrils modified from terminal leaflets.</p>
<p>The family is renowned for its large, often brightly colored, bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic) flowers, typically adapted for pollination by bees, moths, birds, or bats. The characteristic fruit is usually a long, pod-like or flattened capsule that splits open to release numerous flattened seeds equipped with membranous wings for wind dispersal. However, some genera exhibit unusual fleshy, indehiscent fruits, such as the Sausage Tree (<i>Kigelia</i>) and Calabash Tree (<i>Crescentia</i>).</p>
<p>Many species are valued horticulturally as ornamentals for their stunning floral displays or attractive form. Some provide timber, while others have traditional medicinal uses. Phylogenetically, Bignoniaceae is placed within the large order Lamiales, related to mints, verbenas, olives, and plantains.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Predominantly woody plants, including <strong>trees</strong>, <strong>shrubs</strong>, and very commonly <strong>lianas</strong> (woody vines). A few members are herbaceous vines. Lianas frequently climb using specialized structures such as <b>tendrils</b> (often modified terminal leaflets), grappling hooks, or adventitious roots.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually arranged <strong>oppositely</strong> on the stem, less commonly whorled or rarely alternate. They are typically <strong>compound</strong>, either pinnately or palmately, although some genera like <i>Catalpa</i> have simple leaves (considered derived from compound ancestors). In many climbing species, the <b>terminal leaflet is modified into a simple or branched tendril</b>. Leaflet margins are usually entire. Stipules are generally absent, though sometimes modified bud scales (pseudo-stipules) are present at the nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are generally large, showy, bisexual, and strongly <strong>zygomorphic</strong> (bilaterally symmetrical), although some approach radial symmetry. They are typically borne in terminal or axillary racemes, panicles, or cymes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> The sepals are fused (synsepalous) into a tube or bell shape, usually with 5 lobes or teeth, sometimes appearing truncate or splitting irregularly.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> The petals are fused (sympetalous) into a tubular, funnel-shaped, or bell-shaped structure, typically ending in 5 lobes that are often arranged into two lips (<strong>bilabiate</strong>: 2 upper, 3 lower). Corolla color is diverse and often vibrant (yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, white).</li>
<li><strong>Stamens:</strong> Typically <strong>4 fertile stamens</strong>, usually in two pairs of different lengths (<strong>didynamous</strong>), attached to the corolla tube (epipetalous). A fifth stamen is commonly present as a sterile rudiment (<strong>staminode</strong>), or occasionally absent. Anthers often positioned closely in pairs.</li>
<li><strong>Ovary:</strong> Superior, usually consisting of 2 fused carpels forming 2 locules (chambers). Placentation is typically axile, with numerous ovules per locule. A nectar disk is usually present at the ovary base. The style is single and typically ends in a <strong>2-lobed stigma</strong>, the lobes of which are often sensitive and close upon being touched by a pollinator.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The most characteristic fruit is a dry, dehiscent <strong>capsule</strong>, which is often elongated and pod-like (linear) or flattened and oblong/oval. The capsule typically splits into two valves (loculicidal or septicidal dehiscence). Less common fruit types include fleshy, indehiscent berries or hard-shelled calabash-like fruits (<i>Crescentia</i>, <i>Kigelia</i>).</p>
<p>Seeds inside the capsules are typically numerous, flattened, and possess distinctive membranous <strong>wings</strong> that aid wind dispersal. Seeds in fleshy fruits are usually unwinged. Endosperm is absent.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Members often produce iridoid glycosides, a common feature in the Lamiales order. Quinones, such as lapachol found in <i>Tabebuia</i> (potentially toxic but also with medicinal interest), flavonoids, and tannins are also characteristic of the family. Some species yield dyes or have traditional medicinal applications.</p>

<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Bignoniaceae often relies on the combination of woody habit, opposite compound leaves (often with tendrils), showy zygomorphic flowers, and distinctive capsule fruits with winged seeds:</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Mostly <b>woody</b> plants (trees, shrubs, lianas).</li>
<li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Usually <strong>opposite and compound</strong> (pinnate or palmate). In vines, the terminal leaflet is frequently modified into a <b>tendril</b>.</li>
<li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Typically large, showy, <b>zygomorphic</b> (bilaterally symmetrical), tubular or bell-shaped, often two-lipped.</li>
<li><strong>Stamens:</strong> Usually <b>4 fertile stamens</b> (often 2 long, 2 short) plus a fifth sterile <b>staminode</b>.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit:</strong> Most commonly an elongated or flattened, 2-valved <b>capsule</b>.</li>
<li><strong>Seeds:</strong> Typically numerous, flat, and distinctly <b>winged</b> (within capsules).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Fused petals (sympetalous), 5-lobed.</li>
<li><strong>Ovary:</strong> Superior, 2-loculed, with numerous ovules.</li>
<li><strong>Stigma:</strong> Often 2-lobed and sensitive to touch.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Predominantly tropical and subtropical.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year-round:</strong> Woody structure (tree, shrub, liana) is persistent. Opposite leaf arrangement is usually visible.</li>
<li><strong>Growing Season:</strong> Compound leaves (and tendrils on vines) are key vegetative features.</li>
<li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> The large, showy flowers are often the most conspicuous feature when present.</li>
<li><strong>Fruiting Season:</strong> The characteristic capsules (often long and pod-like or flattened) can persist on the plant for extended periods, releasing winged seeds.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other Opposite, Compound-leaved Woody Plants:</strong> Families like Oleaceae (ashes, <i>Fraxinus</i>) or Sapindaceae (maples, <i>Acer</i>) have opposite compound leaves but very different flower structures (often smaller, radially symmetric or nearly so) and fruit types (samaras, schizocarps).</li>
<li><strong>Other Zygomorphic Flowers:</strong> Families like Scrophulariaceae, Plantaginaceae, Lamiaceae (many are herbaceous) have zygomorphic flowers but differ in being mostly herbaceous, having simple leaves (usually), different fruit types (capsules often different shape, nuts, drupes), and often different stamen numbers/arrangements.</li>
<li><strong>Vines with Tendrils:</strong> Vitaceae (grapes) have tendrils opposite the leaves (not modified leaflets) and different flowers/fruits. Fabaceae (legumes) often have tendrils but possess papilionaceous flowers and legume fruits.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Bignoniaceae is a well-established family within the large order <strong>Lamiales</strong>, which belongs to the Lamiid clade of Asterid eudicots. Molecular phylogenetics places Bignoniaceae within the core group of Lamiales, closely related to other major families such as Verbenaceae, Lamiaceae (mints), Acanthaceae, Plantaginaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Oleaceae (olives), and Gesneriaceae.</p>
<p>The family itself is often divided into several tribes based on morphology and molecular data (e.g., Bignonieae - mostly lianas with compound tendrils, Tecomeae - often trees/shrubs, Catalpeae, Oroxyleae, Jacarandeae, Crescentieae - fleshy fruits). The evolution of the liana habit, diverse pollination syndromes (ranging from bees and hummingbirds to moths and bats), and dispersal mechanisms (wind via winged seeds vs. animal dispersal of fleshy fruits) are key aspects of the family's diversification, particularly in the Neotropics.</p>
