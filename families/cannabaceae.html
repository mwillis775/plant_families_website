<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The modern definition of Cannabaceae, established by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) based primarily on molecular data, unites the traditional Hemp family (<i>Cannabis</i> and <i>Humulus</i>) with the formerly recognized Hackberry family (Celtidaceae, including genera like <i>Celtis</i>, <i>Trema</i>, <i>Aphananthe</i>, <i>Gironniera</i>, <i>Pteroceltis</i>, and <i>Lozanella</i>). This combined family belongs to the order <strong>Rosales</strong>, within the Fabid clade of Rosids, and is sister to the clade containing Moraceae (Fig family) and Urticaceae (Nettle family).</p>
<p>This broad circumscription results in a morphologically diverse family with a <strong>cosmopolitan distribution</strong>. Habits range from erect annual herbs (<i>Cannabis</i>) and perennial climbing vines (<i>Humulus</i>) to large deciduous or evergreen trees and shrubs (<i>Celtis</i>, <i>Trema</i>, etc.). Despite the variation, common features include the frequent presence of stipules, predominantly unisexual and wind-pollinated flowers with a simple perianth (tepals) and lacking petals, a superior ovary (usually 1-locular from 2 carpels), and typically 2 styles/stigmas. Fruit types vary according to the lineage: achenes in <i>Cannabis</i> and <i>Humulus</i>, drupes in <i>Celtis</i> and <i>Trema</i>, and samaras in <i>Pteroceltis</i>.</p>
<p>The family holds significant economic and cultural importance through <i><strong>Cannabis sativa</strong></i> (source of fiber, oil, cannabinoids) and <i><strong>Humulus lupulus</strong></i> (hops used in brewing). Trees like <i><strong>Celtis</strong></i> (Hackberry) are ecologically important, providing food and habitat for wildlife (including in Oklahoma, where <i>C. occidentalis</i> is common), and sometimes used for timber. The genus <i>Parasponia</i> is notable as the only non-legume known to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules with rhizobia bacteria.</p>

<section class="family-section" id="characteristics">
<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Highly variable: includes annual or perennial <strong>herbs</strong> (often erect, e.g., <i>Cannabis</i>), perennial twining <strong>vines</strong> with hooked hairs (<i>Humulus</i>), and deciduous or evergreen <strong>trees</strong> and <strong>shrubs</strong> (<i>Celtis</i>, <i>Trema</i>, <i>Aphananthe</i>, etc.). Latex is absent.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaf arrangement is variable: often <strong>alternate</strong>, particularly in woody members (<i>Celtis</i>, <i>Trema</i>), but frequently <strong>opposite</strong>, especially on lower stems or throughout in herbs and vines (<i>Cannabis</i>, <i>Humulus</i>). Leaves are simple or <strong>palmately compound</strong> (<i>Cannabis</i>) or <strong>palmately lobed</strong> (<i>Humulus</i>). Simple leaves are often serrated, sometimes asymmetrical at the base, and frequently show prominent venation (pinnate or strongly 3-veined from the base, as in many <i>Celtis</i>). Paired <strong>stipules</strong> are usually present at the base of the petiole, though they can be deciduous. Cystoliths (mineral concretions in epidermal cells) are common.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Inflorescences are usually axillary (or appearing terminal), often cymose, paniculate, or clustered (fasciculate). Male inflorescences are often more branched and open, sometimes appearing catkin-like (<i>Cannabis</i>, <i>Humulus</i>). Female inflorescences are often more compact. In <i>Humulus</i>, female flowers are grouped in pairs within a distinctive cone-like strobilus composed of overlapping bracts that enlarge in fruit.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are typically small, inconspicuous, greenish, actinomorphic (radially symmetrical), and <strong>unisexual</strong> (plants usually dioecious or monoecious). Wind pollination (anemophily) is the norm. Petals are absent.</p> <ul>
<li><strong>Perianth:</strong> Simple, consisting of usually 5 (range 4-8) distinct or basally fused, sepal-like <strong>tepals</strong>. In female flowers, the perianth is often smaller and may closely surround the ovary.</li>
<li><strong>Male Flowers (Staminate):</strong> Typically have 5 stamens positioned opposite the tepals; filaments are distinct, anthers dehisce longitudinally. A pistillode is usually absent.</li>
<li><strong>Female Flowers (Pistillate):</strong> Possess a <strong>superior ovary</strong>, generally considered to be derived from 2 fused carpels but appearing <strong>1-locular</strong>. Contains a single ovule, usually pendulous from near the apex. Styles are typically <strong>2</strong>, often elongate and linear or feathery (stigmatic along their length). Staminodes are absent.</li> </ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>Fruit type is diverse and reflects the different lineages within the expanded family: typically an <strong>achene</strong> (a small, dry, one-seeded fruit), often enclosed by the persistent perianth or bracts (e.g., <i>Cannabis</i>, <i>Humulus</i>); a fleshy <strong>drupe</strong> (stone fruit) with a hard endocarp (e.g., <i>Celtis</i>, <i>Trema</i>, <i>Gironniera</i>); or rarely a winged <strong>samara</strong> (<i>Pteroceltis</i>). The seed contains a curved (<i>Cannabis</i>, <i>Humulus</i>) or straight (<i>Celtis</i>) embryo, often rich in oil, with little or no endosperm.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>The family is chemically diverse. <i>Cannabis</i> is unique in producing <strong>cannabinoids</strong> (like THC and CBD). <i>Humulus</i> produces bitter resins and essential oils (containing compounds like humulene and myrcene) in glandular hairs (lupulin glands) on female inflorescences. Many members contain tannins and mucilage. <strong>Cystoliths</strong> in leaf epidermal cells are a common feature shared with related families like Urticaceae and Moraceae.</p> </div>

<div class="container">
<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Due to the inclusion of morphologically distinct groups (herbs, vines, trees), identifying Cannabaceae requires recognizing the features characteristic of its main constituent lineages (<i>Cannabis</i>, <i>Humulus</i>, former Celtidaceae).</p> <div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features by Group:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><i>Cannabis</i> type:</strong> Erect annual <strong>herbs</strong>; leaves opposite below, alternate above, <strong>palmately compound</strong> with serrated leaflets; distinct pungent aroma; plants typically dioecious; fruit an <strong>achene</strong>.</li>
<li><strong><i>Humulus</i> type:</strong> Twining perennial <strong>vines</strong> with downward-pointing hairs; leaves mostly opposite, <strong>palmately lobed</strong> (resembling maple or grape leaves); plants dioecious; female inflorescence a distinctive papery, cone-like <strong>strobilus</strong> ("hop"); fruit an <strong>achene</strong> covered by bracts.</li>
<li><strong><i>Celtis</i> / former Celtidaceae type:</strong> <strong>Trees</strong> or shrubs; leaves usually <strong>alternate</strong>, simple, often <strong>asymmetrical at base</strong>, frequently strongly <strong>3-veined</strong> from base, margins serrated or entire; stipules present (often falling early); fruit a small, fleshy <strong>drupe</strong>; bark often distinctively <strong>warty or ridged</strong> (<i>Celtis</i>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General family features (less obvious but unifying):</strong> Presence of stipules (though sometimes small/deciduous); small, unisexual, wind-pollinated flowers lacking petals; superior ovary typically with 2 stigmas.</p>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cystoliths visible on leaf surfaces (requires magnification).</li>
<li>Wind pollination syndrome features (reduced perianth, exposed stamens/stigmas).</li>
<li>Habitat (riparian, forest edge for <i>Humulus</i>; forests, woodlands, urban areas for <i>Celtis</i>; cultivation or disturbed areas for <i>Cannabis</i>).</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips (relevant to Norman, OK)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><i>Celtis</i> (Hackberry):</strong> Recognizable year-round by its often distinctively warty or ridged bark. Alternate, simple, often asymmetrical leaves visible spring through fall. Small, greenish flowers appear in spring with leaves. Small, dark purple drupes mature in late summer/fall and may persist into winter, attracting birds.</li>
<li><strong><i>Cannabis/Humulus</i>:</strong> Less likely to be encountered wild in Oklahoma, but if present, would be seasonal herbs/vines, flowering/fruiting in summer/fall.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><i>Celtis</i>:</strong> May be confused with <i>Ulmus</i> (Elmaceae) which also has alternate, simple, often asymmetrical leaves, but Elms have perfect (bisexual) flowers and winged samara fruits. Other trees with simple alternate leaves lack the combination of 3 main veins, asymmetry, warty bark, and drupe fruit typical of many <i>Celtis</i>.</li>
<li><strong><i>Cannabis</i>:</strong> Palmately compound leaves resemble <i>Acer negundo</i> (Boxelder Maple - opposite leaves, woody tree, samara fruit) or <i>Aesculus</i> species (Buckeye/Horsechestnut - opposite leaves, woody tree, large capsule fruit with large seed). The herbaceous habit and aroma are distinctive.</li>
<li><strong><i>Humulus</i>:</strong> Lobed leaves resemble <i>Vitis</i> (Grapes - alternate leaves, tendrils opposite leaves, different flowers, berry fruit) or <i>Acer</i> (Maples - mostly trees/shrubs, opposite leaves, samara fruit). The twining habit, opposite leaves, and female "cones" are key.</li>
<li><strong>Related Families:</strong> Urticaceae often have similar cystoliths and simple flowers but frequently possess stinging hairs and different leaf arrangements/types. Moraceae often have latex, alternate leaves, and complex inflorescences/fruits (like figs or mulberries).</li>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Cannabaceae belongs to the order <strong>Rosales</strong>, a large and diverse group within the Fabid clade of Rosids. Molecular phylogenetic studies have revolutionized our understanding of this family. Previously, Cannabaceae included only <i>Cannabis</i> and <i>Humulus</i>. However, strong DNA evidence showed that the genera traditionally placed in the family Celtidaceae (e.g., <i>Celtis</i>, <i>Trema</i>, <i>Aphananthe</i>) were deeply nested within or sister to this pair.</p>
<p>To maintain monophyletic families (groups including a common ancestor and all its descendants), the APG system merged Celtidaceae into an expanded Cannabaceae. Within Rosales, this broadened Cannabaceae is now considered the sister group to the clade containing <strong>Moraceae</strong> (Fig family) and <strong>Urticaceae</strong> (Nettle family). Other related families in Rosales include Ulmaceae (Elms), Rhamnaceae (Buckthorns), and Rosaceae itself.</p> <div class="phylogeny-position">
<h3>Position in Plant Phylogeny</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Plantae</li>
<li><strong>Clade:</strong> Angiosperms (Flowering plants)</li>
<li><strong>Clade:</strong> Eudicots</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="related-families (Order Rosales)">
<h3>Related Families</h3>
<p>As a member of the order Rosales, Cannabaceae shares ancestry with diverse families, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moraceae</strong> (Fig and Mulberry family): Often have latex, alternate leaves, stipules covering buds, unisexual flowers often in dense inflorescences (syconium in figs). Sister group with Urticaceae.</li>
<li><strong>Urticaceae</strong> (Nettle family): Often herbs with stinging hairs (but not always), simple flowers, often opposite leaves, cystoliths common. Sister group with Moraceae.</li>
<li><strong>Ulmaceae</strong> (Elm family): Trees/shrubs, alternate simple often asymmetrical leaves, flowers often perfect, fruit typically a samara.</li>
<li><strong>Rosaceae</strong> (Rose family): Huge diversity (herbs, shrubs, trees), often showy flowers with hypanthium, variable fruits (pomes, drupes, achenes, follicles).</li>
<li><strong>Rhamnaceae</strong> (Buckthorn family): Trees/shrubs/vines, often simple leaves, small flowers often with nectar disk, fruit usually a drupe or capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Elaeagnaceae</strong> (Oleaster family): Trees/shrubs often covered in silvery or brown scales, alternate simple leaves, fruit an achene-like drupe. Nitrogen-fixing (<i>Frankia</i>).</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>The expanded Cannabaceae illustrates several evolutionary themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Morphological Diversity within a Clade:</strong> Highlights how molecular phylogenetics can reveal close relationships between groups that appear morphologically very different (e.g., herbaceous <i>Cannabis</i> vs. arboreal <i>Celtis</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Evolution of Habit:</strong> Shows transitions between herbaceous, vining, and tree/shrub forms within a single family lineage.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit Type Evolution:</strong> Diversification of fruit dispersal syndromes (wind-dispersed achenes/samaras vs. animal-dispersed drupes).</li>
<li><strong>Wind Pollination Syndrome:</strong> Represents a major lineage within Rosales that relies predominantly on anemophily, with corresponding reduction in floral structures.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Evolution:</strong> Development of unique secondary metabolites in certain lineages (cannabinoids in <i>Cannabis</i>, hop resins in <i>Humulus</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Nitrogen Fixation Symbiosis:</strong> The presence of rhizobial nitrogen fixation in <i>Parasponia</i> is an exceptional case outside the legume family (Fabaceae), offering insights into the evolution of this crucial symbiosis.</li>
