<h1>Caryocaraceae</h1> <p class="family-common-name">Souari Nut Family</p> <p class="family-description">Caryocaraceae is a small family of trees and shrubs belonging to the order <strong>Malpighiales</strong>, native to the Neotropics. Members are easily recognized by their typically <strong>opposite, trifoliolate leaves</strong> bearing small stipules at the base of the petiole and distinctive <strong>stipels</strong> at the base of the leaflets. They produce large, often showy flowers with <strong>numerous stamens</strong> and develop large, woody <strong>drupaceous fruits</strong>. Several species of <i>Caryocar</i> are important locally for their edible, oily seeds (like the Souari nut) or oily mesocarp (like the Pequi fruit).</p> <img alt="Caryocaraceae example - Caryocar flower highlighting numerous stamens" src="../img/here/caryocaraceae.png"/> </div>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Caryocaraceae is classified within the large and diverse order <strong>Malpighiales</strong>, part of the Fabid (Eurosid I) clade of Rosids. This family is quite small, comprising only two genera, <i><strong>Caryocar</strong></i> and <i><strong>Anthodiscus</strong></i>, with a total of about 25 species. Its distribution is exclusively <strong>Neotropical</strong>, centered in tropical Central and South America, particularly within the Amazon basin and adjacent regions like the Brazilian Cerrado.</p>
<p>The family consists of woody plants, ranging from shrubs to large canopy trees. They are notable for their distinctive leaves, which are usually <strong>opposite</strong> and always <strong>palmately trifoliolate</strong> (having three leaflets). The presence of both stipules at the petiole base and <strong>stipels</strong> at the leaflet bases is a key diagnostic feature. Flowers are large, radially symmetrical, and characterized by having hundreds of long, often colorful stamens. The fruit is also characteristic: a large, heavy, woody drupe containing one or more large, oily seeds (kernels) protected by a very hard inner layer (endocarp).</p>
<p>Several species of <i>Caryocar</i>, such as <i>C. brasiliense</i> (Pequi) and <i>C. nuciferum</i> (Souari nut), are regionally important sources of food and oil, harvested from the wild or semi-cultivated. The oily mesocarp or the seeds are consumed, contributing significantly to local diets and economies in parts of Brazil, Colombia, the Guianas, and other South American countries.</p>

<h3>Quick Facts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> Caryocaraceae Voigt</li> <li><strong>Common Name:</strong> Souari Nut family (or Pequi family)</li> <li><strong>Number of Genera:</strong> 2 (<i>Caryocar</i>, <i>Anthodiscus</i>)</li> <li><strong>Number of Species:</strong> Approximately 25</li> <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Neotropics (Tropical Central &amp; South America)</li> <li><strong>Evolutionary Group:</strong> Eudicots - Rosids (Fabids / Eurosids I) - Order Malpighiales</li> </ul>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Members are <strong>trees</strong> or <strong>shrubs</strong>, often reaching large sizes and contributing to the canopy layer in tropical forests. They have solid wood.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are typically <strong>opposite</strong> and decussate (arranged in perpendicular pairs), though they are alternate in the genus <i>Anthodiscus</i>. They are characteristically <strong>palmately trifoliolate</strong>, meaning each leaf consists of three leaflets attached at the same point on the long petiole. Leaflets are usually large, pinnately veined, often with serrated margins. <strong>Stipules</strong> are present, often conspicuous and interpetiolar (between the petioles of opposite leaves) or intrapetiolar (between the petiole and the stem). A key diagnostic feature is the presence of small, stipule-like structures called <strong>stipels</strong> at the base of each leaflet where it attaches to the main petiole.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Inflorescences are typically <strong>terminal</strong> (at the end of branches), taking the form of a raceme or corymb (a flat-topped or convex raceme). They are often large and bear few to many flowers.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are generally large, showy, actinomorphic (radially symmetrical), and bisexual. They are typically 5-merous, but sometimes 4- or 6-merous. Key features:</p> <ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Consists of 5 (or 4-6) sepals that are fused at the base into a cup-like structure (cupular), often thick or leathery, and persistent in fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Consists of 5 (or 4-6) petals that are free (not fused), large, often thick or fleshy, concave, typically yellowish or whitish, and usually fall off early (deciduous).</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Characterized by <strong>very numerous stamens</strong>, often ranging from 100 to over 700. The long filaments are often brightly colored (yellow, red) and typically fused at their bases into a ring or short tube (monadelphous), or sometimes into indistinct bundles. The outermost stamens may sometimes be sterile (staminodes). Anthers are small, dorsifixed or basifixed, opening by longitudinal slits.</li> <li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> The ovary is <strong>superior</strong>, formed from 4 to 20 fused carpels (syncarpous), resulting in an ovary with the same number of locules as carpels. Placentation is axile, with a single ovule in each locule. A single, long, terminal style with a small capitate or slightly lobed stigma is common (e.g., <i>Caryocar</i>), or styles may be multiple (<i>Anthodiscus</i>).</li> </ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is a large, heavy, typically subglobose <strong>drupe</strong>, though sometimes described as a nut with a fleshy or leathery outer layer (exocarp and mesocarp). The inner layer (<strong>endocarp</strong>) is extremely hard, thick, woody, often with a warty, ridged, or spiny surface. This "stone" encloses 1 to many (up to the original number of locules, though often fewer develop) large seeds (kernels). The mesocarp in some species (<i>C. brasiliense</i>) is notably thick, fleshy, and oily. The seeds are large, kidney-shaped (reniform), rich in oil, and have little or no endosperm.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>The family is known for its high content of <strong>oils</strong>, particularly in the seeds and sometimes the fruit mesocarp. Tannins and possibly saponins may also be present. Importantly, unlike families in the Brassicales order, Caryocaraceae does <strong>not</strong> produce glucosinolates.</p> </div>

<div class="container">
<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Caryocaraceae trees and shrubs are quite distinctive in the Neotropics due to their unique combination of leaf, flower, and fruit characteristics.</p> <div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Trees or shrubs.</li>
<li><strong>Opposite (usually) Trifoliolate Leaves:</strong> Three leaflets per leaf, typically arranged oppositely on the stem (<i>Caryocar</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Stipels Present:</strong> Look for small appendages at the base of each leaflet where it joins the petiole. Stipules also present at petiole base.</li>
<li><strong>Large Flowers with Numerous Stamens:</strong> Showy flowers with hundreds of long, often colorful stamens fused at the base.</li>
<li><strong>Large Woody Drupe/Nut:</strong> Heavy fruit with a very hard, often textured inner layer (endocarp) surrounding large oily seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Neotropical Distribution:</strong> Found only in tropical Central and South America.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terminal Racemes/Corymbs:</strong> Large inflorescences at branch tips.</li>
<li><strong>Superior Ovary:</strong> Ovary positioned above petal/sepal attachment.</li>
<li><strong>Large, Free Petals:</strong> Usually 5 large, fleshy petals.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-locular Ovary:</strong> Ovary with 4-20 chambers.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year-Round:</strong> The distinctive opposite (usually) trifoliolate leaves with stipels are excellent vegetative characters.</li>
<li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Large, showy flowers with masses of stamens are unmistakable when present (timing varies regionally).</li>
<li><strong>Fruiting Season:</strong> The large, heavy, woody fruits are highly characteristic and may persist on the ground after falling.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposite Compound Leaves:</strong> Families like Bignoniaceae or some Verbenaceae may have opposite compound leaves, but flowers are typically zygomorphic with few stamens, and fruits are capsules or different types of drupes. They lack stipels.</li>
<li><strong>Trifoliolate Leaves:</strong> Common in Fabaceae (Legumes), but leaves are usually alternate, flowers are papilionaceous or caesalpinioid, and fruits are legumes. Fabaceae may have stipels but lack the combination of opposite leaves and numerous stamens in actinomorphic flowers.</li>
<li><strong>Other Malpighiales:</strong> This order is huge and diverse. While phylogenetically related, families like Euphorbiaceae, Passifloraceae, or Salicaceae have very different combinations of leaf arrangement, flower structure (often unisexual in Euphorbiaceae, unique structures in Passifloraceae), and fruit types. The combination of opposite trifoliolate leaves with stipels and the specific flower/fruit is key for Caryocaraceae.</li>

<h3><i>Caryocar</i> species (e.g., <i>C. brasiliense</i>, <i>C. nuciferum</i>)</h3>
<p class="example-common-name">Pequi, Souari Nut</p>
<p>The main genus, comprising large trees with opposite, trifoliolate leaves (with stipules and stipels). Flowers are large with yellowish petals and masses of long yellow or reddish stamens. Fruits are large woody drupes. <i>C. brasiliense</i> (Pequi) is famous in Brazil for its strong-flavored, oily yellow mesocarp surrounding the spiny endocarp. <i>C. nuciferum</i> and others (Souari Nuts) are valued for their large, delicious, oily seeds (kernels).</p>

<h3><i>Anthodiscus</i> species (e.g., <i>A. pilosus</i>)</h3>
<p class="example-common-name">Anthodiscus</p>
<p>The second, smaller genus of trees and shrubs found in northern South America (Amazonia, Guianas). It differs from <i>Caryocar</i> primarily in having <strong>alternate</strong> (rather than opposite) trifoliolate leaves, often smaller flowers sometimes in denser clusters, and multiple styles. The fruit is also a woody drupe but typically smaller than in <i>Caryocar</i>. Less well-known and of less economic importance.</p>

<h3><i>Caryocar</i> Fruit Structure</h3>
<p class="example-common-name">Pequi / Souari Nut Fruit</p>
<p>The characteristic large fruit is a drupe with a leathery exocarp, an often oily mesocarp (especially in Pequi), and a very hard, woody endocarp ("stone") that may be smooth, warty, or spiny. Inside the endocarp are 1-4 large, oily, edible seeds or kernels.</p>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Caryocaraceae is placed within the large and highly diverse rosid order <strong>Malpighiales</strong>. This order contains roughly 40 families, including well-known groups like Euphorbiaceae, Salicaceae, Passifloraceae, and Violaceae, representing a major radiation of flowering plants.</p>
<p>The exact position of Caryocaraceae within Malpighiales is still being refined by molecular phylogenetic studies. It is often found to be closely related to a clade containing families like <strong>Rhizophoraceae</strong> (Mangrove family), <strong>Erythroxylaceae</strong> (Coca family), and potentially <strong>Linaceae</strong> (Flax family), although the branching order and relationships among these groups within the broader Malpighiales context can vary between studies. Caryocaraceae represents a morphologically distinct lineage characterized by its unique leaf structure and fruit type within this order.</p> <div class="phylogeny-position">

<h3>Related Families</h3>
<p>As a member of the large Malpighiales order, Caryocaraceae shares distant ancestry with many diverse families. Some potentially closer relatives or notable members of the order include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rhizophoraceae</strong> (Mangrove family): Tropical trees/shrubs, often mangroves, simple opposite leaves, often viviparous fruits.</li>
<li><strong>Erythroxylaceae</strong> (Coca family): Trees/shrubs, simple alternate leaves, source of cocaine.</li>
<li><strong>Linaceae</strong> (Flax family): Mostly herbs/shrubs, simple leaves, source of flax fiber and linseed oil.</li>
<li><strong>Euphorbiaceae</strong> (Spurge family): Huge, diverse family, often with latex, variable leaves, cyathia inflorescences common, capsular fruits typical.</li>
<li><strong>Passifloraceae</strong> (Passionflower family): Often vines with tendrils, distinctive complex flowers, berry or capsular fruits.</li>
<li><strong>Salicaceae</strong> (Willow family): Trees/shrubs, simple alternate leaves, catkin inflorescences, capsular fruits with hairy seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Violaceae</strong> (Violet family): Mostly herbs, often zygomorphic flowers, capsular fruits.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Caryocaraceae offers insights into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diversity within Malpighiales:</strong> Showcases the evolution of the large tree habit and specialized fruit morphology within this vast order.</li>
<li><strong>Leaf Morphology:</strong> The consistent trifoliolate leaf structure with both stipules and stipels is an unusual and specialized trait.</li>
<li><strong>Floral Evolution:</strong> The development of extremely numerous stamens (polyandry) is a notable feature, likely related to pollination strategies (perhaps by large insects or bats).</li>
<li><strong>Fruit Dispersal Syndromes:</strong> The large, heavy, woody fruits with oily rewards suggest dispersal primarily by large mammals (megafaunal dispersal), particularly relevant in the Neotropics.</li>
<li><strong>Ethnobotany and Domestication:</strong> Species like Pequi demonstrate the long history of human interaction and use of native plant resources in South America.</li>
