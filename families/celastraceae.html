<h1>Celastraceae</h1> <p class="family-common-name">Bittersweet Family</p> <p class="family-description">Celastraceae, the <strong>Bittersweet</strong> or <strong>Staff-vine family</strong>, is a large and diverse family of trees, shrubs, and lianas found worldwide (<strong>cosmopolitan</strong>). Classified in the order <strong>Celastrales</strong>, members typically possess simple leaves (often opposite), small, inconspicuous 4- or 5-merous flowers featuring a <strong>prominent nectar disk</strong>, and fruits that are often capsules splitting open to reveal seeds covered in a brightly colored, fleshy <strong>aril</strong>. The family, as defined by APG, includes genera formerly placed in Hippocrateaceae. Well-known members include ornamental <i>Euonymus</i> (Spindle, Burning Bush) and the climbing vines <i>Celastrus</i> (Bittersweet).</p> <img alt="Celastraceae example - Celastrus fruit showing bright red arillate seeds" src="../img/here/celastraceae.png"/> </div>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Celastraceae is the largest family in the order <strong>Celastrales</strong>, a group within the Fabid clade of Rosids. Comprising about 96 genera and over 1,350 species, the family has a <strong>cosmopolitan distribution</strong>, occurring in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions across the globe. Its circumscription has expanded under the APG system to include the formerly recognized family Hippocrateaceae, known for its often 3-staminate flowers.</p>
<p>The family exhibits considerable diversity in habit, including <strong>trees, shrubs, and woody vines (lianas)</strong>. Vegetatively, they usually have simple leaves, often arranged oppositely, and small stipules. Florally, Celastraceae are characterized by small, radially symmetrical flowers, typically with 4 or 5 petals and sepals. A key feature is the presence of a well-developed, fleshy <strong>nectar disk</strong> located inside the whorl of stamens; the stamens themselves (usually 3-5) are typically inserted on this disk. The ovary is usually superior and often embedded within the disk.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking feature for field identification is the fruit and seed morphology of many members. While fruits can be capsules, drupes, berries, or samaras, the seeds are very often partially or wholly covered by a conspicuous, brightly colored (red, orange, pink, yellow), fleshy <strong>aril</strong>. This aril attracts birds and other animals for seed dispersal, especially when capsules dehisce to expose the colorful seeds. Several species are cultivated ornamentally (<i>Euonymus</i>), used medicinally, or known for toxicity. American Bittersweet (<i>Celastrus scandens</i>) is native to eastern Oklahoma, and various <i>Euonymus</i> species are common landscape plants in areas like Norman, OK.</p>

</div>
</section>
<section class="family-section" id="characteristics">
<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Diverse habits including <strong>trees</strong> (small to large), <strong>shrubs</strong> (often erect or scandent), and woody <strong>lianas</strong> (vines) that climb by twining or scrambling. Some species may possess thorns or spines.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually simple (rarely pinnately compound). Arrangement is variable, frequently <strong>opposite</strong> or subopposite, but sometimes <strong>alternate</strong> or spiral. Leaf margins are commonly entire, serrated, or crenated. <strong>Stipules</strong> are typically present but are usually small, scale-like, and often fall off early (deciduous), sometimes leaving a small scar.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Inflorescences are typically determinate (cymose), arising either terminally or, more commonly, from leaf axils. They often form branched cymes, simple or compound clusters (fascicles), or thyrses. Occasionally, flowers are borne solitary.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are generally small (often less than 1 cm diameter), inconspicuous, actinomorphic (radially symmetrical), and usually bisexual (perfect), although some species have unisexual flowers (plants then monoecious, dioecious, or polygamous). Flowers are typically 4- or 5-merous.</p> <ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Consists of 4 or 5 small sepals, typically fused at the base and persistent in fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Consists of 4 or 5 petals that are free (not fused), often spreading or recurved, and typically colored greenish, whitish, yellowish, cream, or sometimes reddish/maroon.</li>
<li><strong>Nectar Disk:</strong> A <strong>prominent, fleshy, intrastaminal nectar disk</strong> is highly characteristic. It can be annular (ring-shaped), cushion-like, or lobed, and is often brightly colored (yellow, orange, red).</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens usually number 3, 4, or 5 (corresponding or alternating with petals, depending on interpretation; sometimes 8 or 10). They are typically inserted on the surface or margin of the nectar disk. Filaments are usually short and distinct; anthers typically dehisce via longitudinal slits. (Genera formerly in Hippocrateaceae often have only 3 stamens).</li> <li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> The ovary is usually <strong>superior</strong> (though sometimes half-inferior or rarely inferior), often partially or wholly embedded within the nectar disk. It is composed of 2 to 5 fused carpels, forming a 2- to 5-locular ovary. Placentation is typically axile, with 1, 2, or sometimes many ovules per locule. A single, usually short style terminates in a capitate or 2- to 5-lobed stigma.</li> </ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>Fruit morphology is diverse across the family. Common types include a loculicidal or septicidal <strong>capsule</strong>, which is often lobed, angled, or winged (<i>Euonymus</i>, <i>Celastrus</i>, <i>Maytenus</i>). Other types include fleshy <strong>drupes</strong> or berries (<i>Maytenus</i>), and winged samaras (<i>Wimmeria</i>). A highly characteristic feature is that the seeds are frequently partially or completely covered by a conspicuous, brightly colored (usually red, orange, yellow, or pink), fleshy or waxy <strong>aril</strong>. This aril often contrasts sharply with the fruit wall after dehiscence. Seeds contain endosperm, which is typically oily or fleshy.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Celastraceae often produce a variety of secondary metabolites, including alkaloids (especially sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids like maytansinoids), triterpenoids (sometimes rubber/gutta-percha), cardiac glycosides, tannins, and flavonoids. Some species are known to be poisonous to humans or livestock if ingested (<i>Euonymus</i>, <i>Celastrus</i>). <i>Catha edulis</i> (Khat) contains stimulating alkaloids (cathinone, cathine).</p> </div>

<div class="container">
<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying members of Celastraceae often relies on a combination of vegetative features, floral characteristics (especially the nectar disk), and particularly the distinctive fruits and arillate seeds.</p> <div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Tree, shrub, or woody vine (liana).</li>
<li><strong>Simple Leaves:</strong> Leaves are typically undivided (simple), arranged oppositely or alternately.</li>
<li><strong>Small Flowers with Prominent Nectar Disk:</strong> Flowers usually small (4-5 parts), but possess a conspicuous, fleshy disk inside the stamens.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit Often a Capsule:</strong> Many common genera have capsules that split open.</li>
<li><strong>Seeds with Brightly Colored Aril:</strong> Seeds exposed after fruit dehiscence are typically covered by a striking red, orange, or pink fleshy aril. This is often the most noticeable feature.</li>
<li><strong>Superior Ovary (Usually):</strong> Ovary positioned above petals/sepals, often embedded in the disk.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stamens 3-5:</strong> Inserted on the nectar disk.</li>
<li><strong>Small Stipules:</strong> Often present but may fall off early.</li>
<li><strong>Axillary or Terminal Cymes:</strong> Common inflorescence types.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips (relevant to Norman, OK)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spring/Summer:</strong> Observe leaf arrangement (opposite/alternate) and shape. Look for small, often greenish flowers and note the presence of the nectar disk (may require hand lens).</li>
<li><strong>Late Summer/Fall/Winter:</strong> This is often the best time for identification. Look for the characteristic fruits. Capsules of <i>Euonymus</i> and <i>Celastrus</i> split open to reveal the brightly colored arillate seeds. These can be very conspicuous after leaves have fallen, especially the red/orange fruits of Bittersweet vines (<i>Celastrus</i>). The drupes/berries of other genera mature in this period.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Families with Opposite Simple Leaves:</strong> e.g., Cornaceae (Dogwoods - usually lack stipules, different flower structure/fruit), Rubiaceae (Coffee family - have interpetiolar stipules, inferior ovary), Caprifoliaceae sensu lato (Honeysuckle family - often zygomorphic flowers, inferior ovary). None typically combine the prominent nectar disk with brightly arillate seeds in a capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Families with Arillate Seeds:</strong> e.g., Sapindaceae (Soapberry family - usually have compound leaves, different flower structure), Fabaceae (Legume family - distinct legume fruit, different flowers).</li>
<li><strong>Families with Prominent Nectar Disks:</strong> e.g., Rhamnaceae (Buckthorns - flowers often different structure, fruit usually a drupe, seeds not typically arillate in the same way), Vitaceae (Grapes - tendrils, different flowers/fruit).</li>
</ul> </div>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Celastraceae is the core family of the order <strong>Celastrales</strong>. This order is part of the large Fabid clade (Eurosids I) within the Rosids. Molecular phylogenetic studies place Celastrales often near the orders Oxalidales and Malpighiales, sometimes collectively referred to as the "COM" clade, indicating a shared ancestry among these three diverse orders.</p>
<p>The circumscription of Celastraceae itself has been broadened based on molecular data to include genera formerly placed in the family Hippocrateaceae (often characterized by 3 stamens). Other small families, Parnassiaceae (incl. Lepuropetalon), are also placed within Celastrales, making it a relatively small order comprising Celastraceae, Parnassiaceae, and the two-species family Lepidobotryaceae. Celastraceae is by far the largest and most widespread family within the order.</p> <div class="phylogeny-position">

</ul>
</div>
<div class="related-families">
<h3>Related Families (Order Celastrales &amp; COM Clade)</h3>
<p>Within the order Celastrales, Celastraceae is related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lepidobotryaceae:</strong> A small family with only 2 genera of trees found disjunctly in Africa and South America.</li>
<li><strong>Parnassiaceae:</strong> Includes <i>Parnassia</i> (Grass-of-Parnassus) and the tiny annual <i>Lepuropetalon</i>. Mostly herbs with distinctive flower structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>The order Celastrales itself is related to other orders within the Fabid Rosids, notably:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oxalidales:</strong> Includes Oxalidaceae (Wood Sorrel family), Connaraceae, Cephalotaceae (Albany Pitcher Plant), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Malpighiales:</strong> A very large and diverse order including families like Euphorbiaceae (Spurges), Salicaceae (Willows), Violaceae (Violets), Passifloraceae (Passionflowers), Rhizophoraceae (Mangroves), Erythroxylaceae (Coca), Linaceae (Flax), and Caryocaraceae.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Celastraceae demonstrates several interesting evolutionary aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit Diversity:</strong> Radiation into trees, shrubs, and successful climbing lianas within a single family lineage.</li>
<li><strong>Floral Conservatism vs. Fruit Diversity:</strong> While flowers are relatively conserved (small, 4-5 merous, nectar disk), fruit types are highly variable (capsule, drupe, berry, samara), indicating diversification in dispersal strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Seed Dispersal Syndromes:</strong> The common evolution of brightly colored, fleshy arils is a strong indicator of adaptation for seed dispersal primarily by birds (ornithochory).</li>
<li><strong>Nectar Disk Evolution:</strong> The prominent nectar disk suggests adaptation to pollination by diverse insects attracted to nectar rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Phylogenetic Placement:</strong> Its position within the COM clade helps understand the broader relationships and evolutionary history of the large Fabid group of Rosids.</li>
