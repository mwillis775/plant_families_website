<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Chrysobalanaceae is a medium-sized family within the vast and diverse order <strong>Malpighiales</strong>, belonging to the Fabid clade of Rosids. It comprises about 27 genera and over 500 species of evergreen <strong>trees and shrubs</strong> distributed across the tropics and subtropics, with the highest diversity found in the Neotropics (Central and South America).</p>
<p>Members of this family are recognized by their typically <strong>alternate, simple leaves</strong> that usually have entire margins, often possess glands on the petioles, and have stipules (though these may be small or fall early). A notable microscopic feature is the common presence of <strong>silica bodies</strong> in the epidermal cells. Flowers in Chrysobalanaceae are often, though not always, <strong>zygomorphic</strong> (bilaterally symmetrical) and are characterized by being perigynous – the floral parts are attached to the rim of a well-developed cup or tube called a <strong>hypanthium</strong> that surrounds the ovary. Within the flower, the stamens (variable in number, often numerous) and the single style are frequently positioned unilaterally (to one side). A particularly distinctive feature is the style, which typically arises from near the <strong>base of the ovary (gynobasic)</strong> rather than the apex. The ovary, though technically superior, sits at the base of the hypanthium and usually develops as if it were single-loculed (pseudomonomerous), ultimately maturing into a fleshy or dry <strong>drupe</strong> containing a single seed.</p>
<p>The family includes species of local economic importance, such as <i>Chrysobalanus icaco</i> (Coco Plum), whose fruits are edible, and various species of <i>Licania</i>, <i>Parinari</i>, and other genera used for timber, traditional medicine, or food. The family is not native to Oklahoma.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Mostly evergreen <strong>trees</strong> (small to large canopy) and <strong>shrubs</strong>.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually arranged <strong>alternately</strong> (rarely opposite), are <strong>simple</strong>, and typically have <strong>entire margins</strong> (rarely toothed). They are often leathery in texture. Petioles frequently bear paired <strong>glands</strong>, either near the apex or at the base of the leaf blade. <strong>Stipules</strong> are present, varying from small and inconspicuous to large and leaf-like, but usually fall off early (deciduous), leaving scars. <strong>Silica bodies</strong> are commonly found within epidermal cells.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Inflorescences are variable, often terminal or axillary, and typically take the form of branched cymes, panicles, or sometimes racemes or clusters (fascicles). Bracts and smaller bracteoles are usually present.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are usually bisexual (perfect), actinomorphic (radially symmetrical) or, more commonly, slightly to strongly <strong>zygomorphic</strong> (bilaterally symmetrical). A key feature is the presence of a well-developed cup-shaped or tubular <strong>hypanthium</strong> (floral tube formed from fused bases of sepals, petals, stamens), making the flower perigynous. Flowers are typically 5-merous.</p> <ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Consists of 5 sepals, fused below to form the hypanthium tube, with 5 free lobes at the rim. Lobes are often unequal in zygomorphic flowers and are persistent in fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Consists of 5 petals (sometimes absent), which are free, attached to the hypanthium rim, often small, sometimes clawed, and may be unequal in size in zygomorphic flowers. Often white, pink, or yellowish.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens are variable in number, ranging from 2 to many (commonly ~10-20, but up to 300+). They are inserted on the rim or inside the hypanthium. In zygomorphic flowers, the stamens are often <strong>unilateral</strong> (grouped to one side) and unequal in length. Filaments are often fused at the base (connate) into a ring or bundles, or adnate to the hypanthium. Sterile stamens (<strong>staminodes</strong>) opposite the fertile ones are common.</li> <li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> The ovary is generally considered <strong>superior</strong> but is located at the base of the hypanthium (appearing inferior or half-inferior). It is composed of typically 3 fused carpels, but functions as if it were 1-locular (<strong>pseudomonomerous</strong>) because usually only one locule fully develops and contains ovules. There are typically 2 ovules per functional locule (often only 1 matures into a seed), attached basally or parietally. The most distinctive feature is the single, long, slender style that arises from near the <strong>base of the ovary (gynobasic)</strong> or laterally from the side, often positioned unilaterally alongside the stamens. The stigma is small, usually simple or slightly 3-lobed.</li> </ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is consistently a <strong>drupe</strong> (a fleshy or sometimes dry fruit with a hard, stony inner layer - the endocarp - surrounding the seed, like a plum or cherry). Drupes vary greatly in size, shape, and texture across the family. The remnant of the gynobasic style is often visible near the base of the fruit. Each drupe contains a single large seed (rarely two). Seeds lack endosperm at maturity; the embryo is large with thick, fleshy, often oily cotyledons.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>The presence of <strong>silica bodies</strong> in epidermal cells is a common characteristic. Plants often contain tannins and various triterpenoids and fatty acids. Some species have been reported to contain cyanogenic glycosides.</p> </div>
</div>

<div class="container">
<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Chrysobalanaceae relies on recognizing the combination of tree/shrub habit, alternate simple entire leaves (with stipules/glands), floral zygomorphy coupled with a hypanthium and gynobasic style, and the characteristic drupe fruit.</p> <div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Tree or shrub, typically evergreen.</li>
<li><strong>Alternate, Simple, Entire Leaves:</strong> Leaves usually have smooth margins.</li>
<li><strong>Stipules Present:</strong> Look for stipules or stipule scars at the base of the petiole.</li>
<li><strong>Petiole Glands:</strong> Often present near the petiole apex or base (may require lens).</li>
<li><strong>Flowers Often Zygomorphic:</strong> Bilaterally symmetrical flowers are common.</li>
<li><strong>Hypanthium Present:</strong> Floral parts attached to a distinct floral cup/tube surrounding the ovary base.</li>
<li><strong>Gynobasic Style:</strong> Style arises from the base or side of the ovary, not the apex (very distinctive).</li>
<li><strong>Fruit a Drupe:</strong> Fleshy or dry fruit with a single hard stone inside.</li>
<li><strong>Pantropical Distribution:</strong> Found in tropical/subtropical regions globally.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stamens often numerous and/or unilateral.</li>
<li>Staminodes often present.</li>
<li>Ovary functionally 1-locular (pseudomonomerous).</li>
<li>Silica bodies present (microscopic feature).</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vegetative State:</strong> Alternate simple entire leaves with stipule scars and potential petiole glands are useful year-round clues for these evergreen plants.</li>
<li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Flowers appear seasonally; observing the zygomorphy, hypanthium, unilateral stamens, and especially the gynobasic style is key for confirmation.</li>
<li><strong>Fruiting Season:</strong> The drupaceous fruits are a consistent family character and aid identification when mature.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rosaceae (Rose Family):</strong> Some have simple alternate leaves, stipules, hypanthia, and drupes (e.g., <i>Prunus</i> - cherries, plums). However, Rosaceae flowers are typically <strong>actinomorphic</strong> with numerous stamens arranged radially, and the style is usually <strong>terminal</strong> on the ovary.</li>
<li><strong>Sapotaceae (Sapodilla Family):</strong> Trees/shrubs with simple alternate leaves, often with latex. Flowers are actinomorphic, lack a hypanthium (usually), ovary is superior, style terminal, fruit usually a berry. Different order (Ericales).</li>
<li><strong>Other Tropical Trees/Shrubs:</strong> Families like Euphorbiaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Lauraceae, Annonaceae have alternate simple leaves but differ greatly in presence/absence of stipules, flower structure (symmetry, perianth type, ovary position/structure, style position), and fruit type (capsules, berries, aggregate fruits, etc.). The combination of features, especially the gynobasic style and drupe fruit, is characteristic of Chrysobalanaceae within its order.</li>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Chrysobalanaceae is firmly placed within the large rosid order <strong>Malpighiales</strong>. This order is exceptionally diverse, containing about 40 families including familiar groups like Euphorbiaceae, Salicaceae, Violaceae, Passifloraceae, Rhizophoraceae, and Linaceae.</p>
<p>Within Malpighiales, molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that Chrysobalanaceae belongs to a clade that also includes the families <strong>Dichapetalaceae</strong>, <strong>Euphroniaceae</strong>, and <strong>Trigoniaceae</strong>. The relationships among these four families are actively being researched, but they appear to form a distinct lineage separate from the main radiations containing Euphorbiaceae or Passifloraceae/Salicaceae within the broader Malpighiales phylogeny.</p> <div class="phylogeny-position">

<h3>Related Families</h3>
<p>Chrysobalanaceae is related to other families within the diverse Malpighiales order. Potentially close relatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dichapetalaceae:</strong> Pantropical trees, shrubs, lianas; often alternate simple leaves; flowers small, often with bifid petals; fruit usually a drupe.</li>
<li><strong>Euphroniaceae:</strong> Small family (1 genus, <i>Euphronia</i>) of shrubs/trees from the Guiana Shield; alternate simple leaves; slightly zygomorphic flowers; fruit a capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Trigoniaceae:</strong> Small family of trees/lianas from Neotropics &amp; Malesia; opposite simple leaves with interpetiolar stipules; zygomorphic flowers; fruit a capsule.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other major families within the larger Malpighiales order include Euphorbiaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Passifloraceae, Salicaceae, Violaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Erythroxylaceae, Linaceae, Caryocaraceae, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Chrysobalanaceae represents a significant lineage within the Malpighiales, illustrating several evolutionary aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tropical Radiation:</strong> Successful diversification of woody plants primarily in tropical ecosystems worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Floral Zygomorphy:</strong> Shows repeated evolution of bilateral symmetry in flowers, likely driven by specialized interactions with pollinators (bees, wasps, butterflies). The unilateral arrangement of stamens and style is particularly notable.</li>
<li><strong>Specialized Gynoecium:</strong> The combination of a pseudomonomerous ovary (functionally single-loculed from multiple carpels) and a distinctly gynobasic style is a unique evolutionary development.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent Fruit Type:</strong> The prevalence of the drupe fruit suggests strong selection for animal dispersal (endozoochory) throughout the family's history.</li>
<li><strong>Silica Accumulation:</strong> The presence of silica bodies may represent an evolutionary adaptation for structural support or defense against herbivores.</li>
