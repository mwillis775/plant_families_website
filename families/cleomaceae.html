<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Cleomaceae is a family within the order <strong>Brassicales</strong>, positioned phylogenetically very close to the Brassicaceae (mustard family), likely as its sister group. It was separated from the Capparaceae (caper family) based on molecular evidence showing that Cleomaceae+Brassicaceae form a distinct clade separate from Capparaceae sensu stricto. The family comprises about 10-17 genera and around 300 species, distributed mainly in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide but extending into warm temperate zones.</p>
<p>Most members are annual or perennial <strong>herbs</strong>, though some are shrubby. They often possess glandular hairs making them sticky to the touch and frequently have a pungent odor due to the presence of <strong>glucosinolates</strong> (mustard oil glycosides), a chemical trait shared with Brassicaceae and Capparaceae. Leaves are typically <strong>alternate</strong> and characteristically <strong>palmately compound or lobed</strong>. Flowers are often showy, usually <strong>zygomorphic</strong> (bilaterally symmetrical), with 4 distinct petals (often clawed) and typically <strong>6 stamens</strong> with long, exserted filaments resembling spider legs. A distinctive feature is that the superior ovary (and subsequent fruit) is often borne on a noticeable stalk called a <strong>gynophore</strong>. The fruit is typically an elongated capsule that strongly resembles the silique of Brassicaceae, usually splitting open via two valves to leave the seeds attached to a persistent central frame, the <strong>replum</strong>.</p>
<p>While some species like <i>Cleome hassleriana</i> are popular garden ornamentals (Spider Flower), others are considered weeds. Several species, particularly in the genus <i>Polanisia</i> (Clammyweeds) and related groups (sometimes classified within <i>Cleome</i> sensu lato), are native or naturalized in North America, including Oklahoma, often found in sandy soils or disturbed areas.</p>

<section class="family-section" id="characteristics">
<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Predominantly annual or perennial <strong>herbs</strong>, sometimes becoming somewhat shrubby at the base. Plants are often covered with simple or branched <strong>glandular hairs</strong>, making them feel sticky (viscid) and often emitting a strong, pungent, or unpleasant odor (due to glucosinolates and other compounds).</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually arranged <strong>alternately</strong> and spirally along the stem. They are typically <strong>palmately compound</strong>, usually with 3 to 7 leaflets radiating from the end of the petiole. Sometimes leaves are palmately lobed, or the uppermost leaves near the inflorescence may be simple. Leaves are petiolate. <strong>Stipules</strong>, when present, are usually small and simple, sometimes spine-like, or absent.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>The inflorescence is typically a terminal <strong>raceme</strong>, which is often bracteate (flowers subtended by bracts, which may be leaf-like below) and frequently elongates significantly as the fruits develop.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are usually bisexual (perfect) and typically distinctly <strong>zygomorphic</strong> (bilaterally symmetrical), although some can be nearly actinomorphic. They are generally 4-merous.</p> <ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Consists of 4 sepals, which are usually distinct (free) or only slightly fused at the base, often falling off early (deciduous).</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Consists of 4 petals, which are free and often prominently <strong>clawed</strong> (having a narrow stalk-like base and an expanded blade). Petals are frequently unequal in size or orientation (e.g., pointing upwards), contributing to the zygomorphy. Colors include white, yellow, pink, rose, or purple.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens typically number <strong>6</strong> (though the range is 4 to many across the family, 6 is common and links to Brassicaceae). Filaments are often very long and extend far beyond the petals (<strong>exserted</strong>), contributing to the "spider flower" appearance. Stamens are frequently borne, along with the gynoecium, on an elongated section of the receptacle called an <strong>androgynophore</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> The ovary is <strong>superior</strong> and typically consists of 2 fused carpels. A key feature is that the ovary is usually elevated on a distinct stalk called the <strong>gynophore</strong> (which itself arises from the androgynophore, if present). The ovary is generally 1-locular with numerous ovules attached to two parietal placentas (on the ovary walls), but a membranous false septum, the <strong>replum</strong>, often connects the placentas (as in Brassicaceae). A single style (short or long) terminates in a small, usually capitate (head-like) stigma.</li> </ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The characteristic fruit is a <strong>capsule</strong>, typically elongated and linear (resembling a silique) or sometimes oblong or shorter (resembling a silicle). It is often borne on the persistent, elongated gynophore, making the fruit <strong>stipitate</strong> (stalked). The capsule typically dehisces by means of 2 valves separating from bottom to top, falling away to leave the seeds attached to the persistent, rim-like placental frame (the <strong>replum</strong>) and the associated false septum. Seeds are numerous, often kidney-shaped (reniform) or somewhat coiled, usually with a rough or patterned seed coat, and lacking significant endosperm.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Like their close relatives Brassicaceae and Capparaceae, members of Cleomaceae produce <strong>glucosinolates</strong> (mustard oil glycosides). Hydrolysis of these compounds produces isothiocyanates, responsible for the pungent smell and taste of many species. Glandular hairs producing sticky or volatile compounds are also common.</p> </div>

<div class="container">
<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Cleomaceae species are often recognized by their herbaceous habit, palmate leaves, characteristic flowers with long stamens, stalked capsular fruits with a replum, and often pungent odor.</p> <div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Mostly herbs (annual or perennial), often glandular-hairy/sticky.</li>
<li><strong>Alternate, Palmate Leaves:</strong> Leaves typically palmately compound or lobed (check upper leaves which may be simple).</li>
<li><strong>Zygomorphic Flowers (Usually):</strong> Flowers often bilaterally symmetrical with 4 distinct, often clawed petals.</li>
<li><strong>6 Long Stamens (Typically):</strong> Stamens usually 6, with long filaments projecting well beyond petals ("spider legs").</li>
<li><strong>Stalked Ovary/Fruit (Gynophore):</strong> Look for the distinct stalk elevating the ovary and the resulting capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Silique-like Capsule with Replum:</strong> Fruit resembles a mustard silique, typically splitting via 2 valves leaving a persistent central frame (replum).</li>
<li><strong>Glucosinolate Odor:</strong> Crushed tissues often smell pungent or like mustard.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution/Habitat:</strong> Some species (<i>Polanisia</i>, <i>Cleome</i>) found in Oklahoma/central US, often in open, sandy, or disturbed areas.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flowers arranged in terminal racemes that elongate in fruit.</li>
<li>4 distinct sepals.</li>
<li>Superior ovary, 2 carpels, parietal placentation.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips (relevant to Oklahoma)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spring/Summer:</strong> Look for vegetative growth; alternate palmate leaves and glandular hairs are good clues for <i>Polanisia</i>.</li>
<li><strong>Summer/Fall:</strong> Flowering period. Look for the distinctive zygomorphic flowers with long stamens, and check for the developing stalked capsules below opened flowers on the elongating raceme. Pungent smell often noticeable on hot days or when brushed.</li>
<li><strong>Habitat:</strong> Check roadsides, sandy fields, waste areas, riverbanks for native/weedy species like <i>Polanisia dodecandra</i>.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brassicaceae (Mustard Family):</strong> Very closely related. Distinguished by Brassicaceae usually having <strong>actinomorphic</strong> flowers, <strong>6 tetradynamous stamens</strong> (4 long + 2 short, not typically long-exserted like Cleomaceae), usually <strong>sessile</strong> ovary/fruit (lacking gynophore), and often pinnately lobed or simple leaves (though some are palmate).</li>
<li><strong>Capparaceae (Caper Family):</strong> Also related (Brassicales). Capparaceae often have &gt;6 stamens (sometimes numerous), fruit structure may differ (e.g., berry, or capsule without typical replum), flowers can be actinomorphic or zygomorphic, leaves simple or palmate, often more shrubby. Gynophore present in many Capparaceae too.</li>
<li><strong>Fabaceae (Legume Family):</strong> Some have palmate leaves (<i>Lupinus</i>, <i>Trifolium</i>), but flowers are highly distinctive (papilionaceous or caesalpinioid), stamens often fused (diadelphous/monadelphous), and fruit is a legume pod.</li>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Cleomaceae belongs to the order <strong>Brassicales</strong>, within the Malvid clade of Rosids. Its phylogenetic position has been clarified significantly by molecular studies. Once broadly included within Capparaceae, Cleomaceae is now recognized as a distinct family that is much more closely related to <strong>Brassicaceae</strong> (the mustard family) than it is to Capparaceae sensu stricto.</p>
<p>Current evidence strongly suggests that Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae are <strong>sister families</strong>, forming a well-supported clade within the core Brassicales. This close relationship explains the shared features like the presence of glucosinolates and the silique-like fruit with a replum (though flowers are typically zygomorphic with 6 equal stamens in Cleomaceae vs. actinomorphic with 4+2 tetradynamous stamens in Brassicaceae). The separation from Capparaceae reflects the finding that Capparaceae s.s. represents a more distant branch within the order.</p> <div class="phylogeny-position">

<h3>Related Families</h3>
<p>As a member of the order Brassicales, Cleomaceae is related to other families sharing traits like glucosinolate production. Key relatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brassicaceae</strong> (Mustard or Cabbage family): The sister family to Cleomaceae. Huge economic importance. Usually actinomorphic flowers, 6 tetradynamous stamens (4 long + 2 short), ovary usually sessile.</li>
<li><strong>Capparaceae</strong> (Caper family): Formerly included Cleomaceae. Now more distant. Often shrubs/trees, &gt;6 stamens common, fruit capsule or berry, replum often absent/different.</li>
<li><strong>Resedaceae</strong> (Mignonette family): Mostly herbs, often zygomorphic flowers but different structure (fringed petals), fruit usually an open-topped capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Caricaceae</strong> (Papaya family): Pachycaul trees/shrubs, palmate leaves, large berry fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Moringaceae</strong> (Horseradish Tree family): Trees, pinnate leaves, zygomorphic flowers, long capsule fruit.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Cleomaceae holds particular evolutionary interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sister Group to Brassicaceae:</strong> Provides a crucial comparison point for understanding the evolution of the massive and economically vital mustard family. It helps researchers infer ancestral traits and track the evolution of features like floral symmetry (zygomorphy vs. actinomorphy) and stamen arrangement (equal vs. tetradynamous).</li>
<li><strong>Evolution of Floral Symmetry:</strong> The prevalence of zygomorphy contrasts with the typical actinomorphy in Brassicaceae, offering insights into drivers of floral shape evolution.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit Morphology Bridge:</strong> The silique-like capsule with a replum clearly links it morphologically to Brassicaceae, despite floral differences.</li>
<li><strong>Glucosinolate Chemistry:</strong> Studying the diversity and function of mustard oils in Cleomaceae contributes to understanding the chemical ecology and evolution within the Brassicales order.</li>
<li><strong>Taxonomic Realignment:</strong> Its separation from Capparaceae is a good example of how molecular data can refine traditional classifications based on morphology.</li>
