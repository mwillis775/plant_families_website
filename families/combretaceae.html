<h1>Combretaceae</h1>
<p class="family-common-name">White Mangrove / Indian Almond Family</p>
<p class="family-description">Combretaceae is a large family of predominantly tropical and subtropical <strong>trees, shrubs, and lianas</strong> (woody vines), belonging to the order <strong>Myrtales</strong>. Members typically possess <strong>simple, entire leaves</strong> with variable arrangement (alternate, opposite, or whorled) and usually lack stipules. Their flowers, often borne in spikes, racemes, or heads, feature a distinct <strong>hypanthium</strong> (floral tube), are frequently <strong>apetalous</strong> (lacking petals), have an <strong>inferior ovary</strong> (usually 1-locular with apical ovules), and develop into characteristic fruits, which are often dry and <strong>winged (samaras)</strong> or fleshy <strong>drupes</strong>. The family includes ecologically important mangrove species (<i>Laguncularia</i>, <i>Lumnitzera</i>) and economically useful trees like Indian Almond (<i>Terminalia catappa</i>).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Combretaceae is a significant family within the order <strong>Myrtales</strong> (part of the Malvid clade of Rosids), containing about 11-18 genera and around 500 species. It has a wide <strong>pantropical and subtropical</strong> distribution, with centers of diversity in Africa and Asia, but also well-represented in the Neotropics and Australia. The family exhibits considerable habit diversity, including large trees, shrubs, and a large number of woody climbers (<strong>lianas</strong>), especially in the genus <i>Combretum</i>. Notably, it also includes several species adapted to saline coastal environments, forming important components of <strong>mangrove</strong> ecosystems (<i>Laguncularia</i>, <i>Lumnitzera</i>, <i>Conocarpus</i>).</p>
<p>Key characteristics unify this diverse group. Leaves are simple and usually entire-margined, but their arrangement (alternate, opposite, whorled) can vary even within a single genus. Stipules are generally absent or minute. Microscopically, unique compartmentalized hairs (<strong>combretaceous hairs</strong>) are often present. Flowers are typically 4- or 5-merous and are borne on a distinct floral tube or cup (<strong>hypanthium</strong>). Petals are often small or, very commonly, completely absent (<strong>apetalous</strong>). The stamens, usually twice the number of sepals (e.g., 8 or 10), are often long and project prominently from the flower. The ovary is consistently <strong>inferior</strong> and typically single-loculed with a few ovules hanging from the apex (apical placentation). The fruit is distinctive and diagnostic: usually a single-seeded, indehiscent fruit that is either dry and prominently <strong>winged</strong> (a samara or pseudo-samara adapted for wind or water dispersal) or a fleshy or leathery <strong>drupe</strong>.</p>
<p>Economically, Combretaceae provides valuable timber (<i>Terminalia</i>), edible fruits or nuts (<i>Terminalia catappa</i> - Indian Almond, <i>Chrysobalanus icaco</i> often included here in older classifications but now usually separate), tannins (from bark/fruits), and traditional medicines. Several species, especially from <i>Combretum</i> (including the former <i>Quisqualis indica</i>, Rangoon Creeper), are cultivated as ornamentals for their showy flowers or interesting fruits. No members are native to Oklahoma.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Mostly woody plants: <strong>trees</strong> (small to large canopy), <strong>shrubs</strong>, or very commonly woody <strong>lianas</strong> (climbers). Includes specialized <strong>mangrove</strong> species adapted to intertidal saline habitats.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaf arrangement is variable, often diagnostic at the generic level: <strong>alternate</strong>, <strong>opposite</strong>, or sometimes <strong>whorled</strong>. Leaves are <strong>simple</strong>, usually with <strong>entire margins</strong> (rarely slightly toothed or wavy). Petioles present or absent. Stipules are typically absent or minute and quickly falling (caducous). Microscopic unicellular hairs divided by transverse septa (<strong>combretaceous hairs</strong>) are characteristic of the family, often found on leaves or other surfaces. Pits or glands (domatia) may be present in vein axils on the underside.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Inflorescences are diverse, often consisting of dense spikes, racemes, panicles, or sometimes condensed into globose heads. They are typically terminal or axillary. Flowers are usually subtended by bracts.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are usually bisexual (perfect), but sometimes unisexual (plants then monoecious or dioecious). They are typically actinomorphic (radially symmetrical), usually 4- or 5-merous, and perigynous or epigynous with a well-developed <strong>hypanthium</strong> (floral tube) extending above the ovary.</p> <ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Consists of 4 or 5 sepal lobes borne on the rim of the hypanthium, usually small and persistent.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Consists of 4 or 5 petals (if present), which are free, inserted on the hypanthium rim, often small and inconspicuous. Petals are frequently <strong>absent (apetalous)</strong> in many genera (<i>Terminalia</i>, <i>Laguncularia</i>, <i>Conocarpus</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens usually number twice the sepals, i.e., <strong>8 or 10</strong>, typically arranged in two whorls (diplostemonous) and inserted inside the hypanthium. Sometimes only 4 or 5 stamens are present, or rarely numerous. Filaments are often long and extend well beyond the perianth (exserted). Anthers are typically dorsifixed and versatile (swinging freely). A nectar disk is often present at the base of the hypanthium, inside the stamens.</li> <li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> The ovary is consistently <strong>inferior</strong> (or appears so, being fused with and enclosed by the hypanthium). It is composed of 2-5 fused carpels but is typically functionally <strong>1-locular</strong> due to the suppression or breakdown of septa. It contains few (usually 2-5, rarely up to 20) ovules which are pendulous from the apex of the locule (<strong>apical placentation</strong>). A single, simple, usually slender and elongated style arises from the ovary apex, terminating in a small, usually simple or capitate stigma.</li> </ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is typically dry or fleshy, indehiscent, and contains a single seed. A very common fruit type is a dry, <strong>winged fruit (samara</strong> or pseudo-samara), where the wings (usually 2-5) are derived from the persistent hypanthium/calyx or develop as outgrowths of the ovary wall. These are adapted for wind or water dispersal. Alternatively, the fruit can be a fleshy or leathery <strong>drupe</strong>. The single seed lacks endosperm at maturity; the embryo is large, often with folded, coiled, or spirally twisted cotyledons.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>The family is rich in <strong>tannins</strong>, especially ellagitannins, found in bark, leaves, and fruits, contributing to their use in tanning and traditional medicine. Triterpenes and flavonoids are also common. Some species accumulate aluminum. The unique <strong>combretaceous hairs</strong> are a structural characteristic.</p> </div>

<div class="container">
<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Combretaceae often involves recognizing the woody habit, simple entire leaves (with variable arrangement), flowers with an inferior ovary borne on a hypanthium (often lacking petals), and especially the characteristic winged or drupaceous fruits.</p> <div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Tree, shrub, or woody liana (many climbers).</li>
<li><strong>Simple, Entire Leaves:</strong> Margins smooth; arrangement alternate, opposite, or whorled.</li>
<li><strong>Stipules Absent or Minute:</strong> Unlike some related families (e.g., Rhizophoraceae).</li>
<li><strong>Flowers with Hypanthium:</strong> Floral parts attached to a tube above the ovary.</li>
<li><strong>Often Apetalous:</strong> Petals frequently absent or very small.</li>
<li><strong>Inferior Ovary:</strong> Ovary positioned below main floral whorls (within hypanthium).</li>
<li><strong>Ovary 1-locular, Apical Placentation:</strong> Single chamber with ovules hanging from top.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit Winged (Samara-like) or Drupe:</strong> Highly characteristic fruit types, usually 1-seeded.</li>
<li><strong>Tropical/Subtropical Distribution:</strong> Including mangrove habitats for some genera.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flowers often in spikes, racemes, or heads.</li>
<li>Stamens usually 8 or 10, often long-exserted.</li>
<li>Combretaceous hairs present (microscopic).</li>
<li>Cotyledons often folded or coiled within seed.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year-Round:</strong> Habit and leaf characteristics (simple, entire, arrangement) are useful. Check for persistent winged fruits on tree/ground or characteristic drupes. Mangrove habitat is a strong clue for relevant genera.</li>
<li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Flowers appear seasonally, often showy in clusters (<i>Combretum</i>) or dense spikes (<i>Terminalia</i>, <i>Laguncularia</i>). Note absence/presence of petals and inferior ovary.</li>
<li><strong>Fruiting Season:</strong> Mature fruits (winged samaras or drupes) are highly diagnostic and visible after flowering.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lythraceae (Crape Myrtle Family):</strong> Also in Myrtales, often opposite leaves, flowers with hypanthium. Differ in usually having conspicuous (often crumpled) petals, typically superior or semi-inferior ovary, and fruit usually a capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Onagraceae (Evening Primrose Family):</strong> Also in Myrtales, flowers with hypanthium and inferior ovary. Differ in typically having 4 petals and 8 stamens, often different leaf margins (toothed), and fruit usually a capsule or nutlet. Mostly herbs.</li>
<li><strong>Myrtaceae (Myrtle Family):</strong> Also in Myrtales, trees/shrubs often with opposite simple entire leaves. Differ in usually having pellucid leaf dots (aromatic), numerous conspicuous stamens, inferior ovary, and fruit typically a berry or capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Families with Winged Fruits:</strong> Many unrelated families have winged fruits (e.g., Aceraceae/Sapindaceae, Ulmaceae, Betulaceae). Combretaceae samaras are distinct, often with 2-5 wings derived from hypanthium/ovary wall, containing a single seed from an inferior ovary.</li>
<li><strong>Mangrove Species:</strong> Distinguish Combretaceae mangroves (<i>Laguncularia</i>, <i>Lumnitzera</i>, <i>Conocarpus</i>) from Rhizophoraceae (Red Mangroves - opposite leaves, prominent stipules, often prop roots, viviparous seedlings) and Avicenniaceae/Acanthaceae (<i>Avicennia</i> - Black Mangroves - opposite leaves, pneumatophores, different flowers/fruit).</li>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Combretaceae is a core member of the order <strong>Myrtales</strong>, situated within the Malvid clade of Rosids. This order is characterized by features such as opposite leaves (common but not universal), flowers with a hypanthium, inferior or semi-inferior ovaries (common), often numerous stamens, and included phloem in the vascular tissue.</p>
<p>Molecular phylogenetic studies place Combretaceae sister to the large clade comprising the families <strong>Lythraceae</strong> (Loosestrife family, including Pomegranates and Crape Myrtles) and <strong>Onagraceae</strong> (Evening Primrose family). This grouping (Combretaceae + (Lythraceae + Onagraceae)) is then typically sister to the massive family <strong>Myrtaceae</strong> (Myrtles, Eucalyptus). Together with other families like Melastomataceae and Vochysiaceae, they form the well-supported Myrtales order, which represents a significant radiation primarily of woody plants.</p> <div class="phylogeny-position">

<h3>Related Families</h3>
<p>As a member of the order Myrtales, Combretaceae is related to several other prominent families:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lythraceae</strong> (Loosestrife / Crape Myrtle family): Herbs, shrubs, trees; often opposite leaves; flowers with hypanthium, petals often crumpled, numerous stamens common; superior/semi-inferior ovary; fruit usually a capsule. Includes Pomegranate (<i>Punica</i>). Sister group with Onagraceae.</li>
<li><strong>Onagraceae</strong> (Evening Primrose / Fuchsia family): Mostly herbs; leaves variable; flowers often 4-merous with long hypanthium, inferior ovary; fruit usually a capsule or berry. Sister group with Lythraceae.</li>
<li><strong>Myrtaceae</strong> (Myrtle / Eucalyptus family): Huge family of trees/shrubs; usually opposite simple entire leaves with pellucid dots (aromatic); flowers often with numerous conspicuous stamens; inferior ovary; fruit a berry or capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Melastomataceae:</strong> Large family (mostly tropical); herbs/shrubs/trees/vines; opposite leaves often with characteristic acrodromous venation (3-9 main veins); flowers often showy with distinct stamens; inferior ovary; fruit a berry or capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Vochysiaceae:</strong> Neotropical and African trees/shrubs; opposite or whorled leaves; zygomorphic flowers often spurred; fruit usually a samara or capsule.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Combretaceae represents a major evolutionary lineage within the Myrtales order:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radiation in Tropics:</strong> Successfully diversified into trees, shrubs, and especially numerous liana species across global tropical ecosystems.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptation to Mangrove Habitats:</strong> Independently evolved adaptations (along with unrelated families) to colonize saline intertidal zones, showcasing convergent evolution.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit Dispersal Mechanisms:</strong> Exhibits remarkable diversity in fruit morphology, particularly the repeated evolution of winged samara-like fruits adapted for wind and water dispersal, alongside fleshy drupes for animal dispersal.</li>
<li><strong>Floral Reduction:</strong> The frequent loss of petals (apetaly) represents a significant trend in floral evolution within the family, likely related to pollination syndromes (wind or specialized insects).</li>
<li><strong>Myrtales Phylogeny:</strong> Its position helps clarify relationships among major families within the Myrtales, particularly linking to Lythraceae and Onagraceae.</li>
