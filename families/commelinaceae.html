<h1>Commelinaceae</h1>
<p class="family-common-name">Spiderwort Family / Dayflower Family</p>
<p class="family-description">Commelinaceae, the spiderwort or dayflower family, is a medium-sized family of monocots (order Commelinales) with about 40 genera and over 700 species. These plants are typically somewhat succulent herbs, easily recognized by their simple leaves with closed basal sheaths encircling the stem. Their flowers, often blue or purple and frequently lasting only a single day (ephemeral), usually have 3 distinct sepals and 3 delicate petals. Stamens are notable for often being unequal or bearing conspicuous hairs. The fruit is typically a capsule.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Commelinaceae family is distributed worldwide, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, but with significant representation in temperate zones. Common genera include <i>Tradescantia</i> (spiderworts), known for their radially symmetric flowers with often hairy stamens, and <i>Commelina</i> (dayflowers), characterized by zygomorphic flowers with two large upper petals and one reduced lower petal, often emerging from a folded spathe-like bract. Other notable genera are <i>Murdannia</i>, <i>Callisia</i>, and <i>Cyanotis</i>.</p>
<p>Many species are popular horticultural subjects, especially various <i>Tradescantia</i> species and cultivars grown as houseplants (like the popular 'Wandering Jew' or Inch Plant, <i>T. zebrina</i>) or as garden perennials (various spiderworts). Others, like some <i>Commelina</i> and <i>Murdannia</i> species, can be weedy in disturbed areas or agricultural fields. The flowers are typically ephemeral, opening in the morning and wilting by midday, sometimes deliquescing into a liquid blob. The often brightly colored hairs on the stamen filaments are thought to play a role in attracting pollinators, possibly by mimicking pollen or nectar.</p>
<p>Several species are native to Oklahoma (current location as of March 2025), including Ohio Spiderwort (<i>Tradescantia ohiensis</i>) found in prairies and open areas, and Erect Dayflower (<i>Commelina erecta</i>) common in sandy soils and disturbed sites.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Mostly perennial or annual herbs, often somewhat succulent with fleshy or watery stems and leaves. Stems are typically terrestrial, sometimes creeping and rooting at the nodes, often appearing jointed due to the prominent leaf sheaths.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are simple, usually with entire (smooth) margins, and arranged alternately (spirally or in two ranks) along the stem. Venation is parallel. A key diagnostic feature is the leaf base forming a distinct closed sheath that completely encircles the stem (unlike grasses where the sheath is usually open).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Inflorescences are typically terminal or axillary clusters of flowers arranged in cymes. These cymes are often helicoid (coiled) and frequently emerge from, or are enclosed within, one or more folded, boat-shaped or leaf-like bracts called spathes (especially prominent in <i>Commelina</i>).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are usually bisexual, actinomorphic (radially symmetric, e.g., <i>Tradescantia</i>) or distinctly zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetric, e.g., <i>Commelina</i>). They are characteristically ephemeral, often lasting only a few hours in the morning, and sometimes deliquescing (dissolving) into a jelly-like substance after blooming. Flowers are typically 3-merous.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perianth:</strong> Clearly differentiated into calyx and corolla (unlike many other Liliales).
                            <ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Composed of 3 distinct (free) sepals, typically green and herbaceous, sometimes boat-shaped.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Composed of 3 distinct (free) petals, which are usually delicate, thin-textured (membranous), and often narrowed into a claw at the base. Petal color is commonly blue or purple, but also pink, white, or rarely yellow. In zygomorphic flowers like <i>Commelina</i>, the petals are unequal in size, with two large upper/lateral petals and one much smaller, often inconspicuous lower petal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens typically number 6, arranged in two whorls of 3, but they are often modified or unequal. It is common for some stamens to be sterile (staminodes), shorter, or otherwise different from the fertile ones. Filaments are frequently adorned with conspicuous, often brightly colored, moniliform (bead-like) hairs. Anthers dehisce via longitudinal slits or sometimes pores.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> Ovary is superior, composed of 3 fused carpels forming 3 (or sometimes 2) locules (chambers). Placentation is axile, with few ovules per locule. A single simple style terminates in a single small stigma, which may be capitate (head-like) or slightly 3-lobed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is typically a thin-walled capsule that splits open along the partitions between the locules (loculicidal dehiscence) to release the seeds. Seeds are few per capsule, often brownish or black, and frequently have distinctive textured or patterned seed coats. A small, cap-like structure (operculum) often covers the embryo. The endosperm is abundant and mealy (starchy).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Plants often contain mucilage cells contributing to their somewhat succulent feel. Raphide crystals (needle-shaped bundles of calcium oxalate) are common in tissues. Blue and purple flower colors are due to anthocyanin pigments. The family generally lacks the potent alkaloids or glycosides found in some other monocot families.</p>

<section class="family-section" id="identification">
<div class="container">
<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Commelinaceae relies on recognizing the combination of herbaceous monocot features, especially the closed leaf sheaths, distinct 3+3 perianth, and often modified stamens.</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Herbaceous Habit:</strong> Plants are non-woody, often somewhat fleshy.</li>
<li><strong>Closed Leaf Sheaths:</strong> Leaf bases wrap completely around the stem, forming a closed tube.</li>
<li><strong>Alternate, Simple Leaves:</strong> Leaves arranged alternately, simple shape, parallel veins.</li>
<li><strong>3 Sepals + 3 Petals:</strong> Perianth clearly differentiated into 3 (usually green) sepals and 3 (usually colored, delicate) petals.</li>
<li><strong>Often Modified Stamens:</strong> Typically 6 stamens (or staminodes), filaments frequently bear conspicuous hairs.</li>
<li><strong>Superior Ovary:</strong> Ovary positioned above other floral parts.</li>
<li><strong>Capsule Fruit:</strong> Dry fruit splitting open into locules.</li>
<li><strong>Ephemeral Flowers:</strong> Flowers often last only part of a day.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flower Symmetry:</strong> Radially symmetric (<i>Tradescantia</i>) vs. bilaterally symmetric (<i>Commelina</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Unequal Petals:</strong> Two large + one small petal in <i>Commelina</i>.</li>
<li><strong>Spathe Bracts:</strong> Inflorescence often emerging from folded, boat-shaped bracts (<i>Commelina</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Jointed Stems:</strong> Stems often appear segmented at the nodes due to prominent sheaths.</li>
<li><strong>Flower Color:</strong> Commonly blue, purple, or pink.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spring/Summer/Fall:</strong> Main growing and flowering season. Ephemeral flowers best observed in the morning.</li>
<li><strong>Year-round (Indoors/Frost-free):</strong> Houseplant species (<i>Tradescantia zebrina</i>, <i>Callisia</i>) visible year-round.</li>
<li><i>(Current Time Context: Late March in Oklahoma - Too early for most native Commelinaceae like </i>Tradescantia<i> or </i>Commelina<i> to be flowering, but vegetative growth might start with warmer weather).</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Liliaceae / Colchicaceae / Melanthiaceae:</strong> Also monocots with 6 perianth parts, but these are usually undifferentiated tepals (not distinct sepals/petals). Leaf sheaths typically open or less prominent. Different stamen/style structures (e.g., usually single style in Liliaceae, 3 distinct styles in Colchicaceae).</li>
<li><strong>Iridaceae (Iris Family):</strong> Have 6 tepals, but only 3 stamens and an inferior ovary.</li>
<li><strong>Orchidaceae (Orchid Family):</strong> Highly specialized zygomorphic flowers, inferior ovary, pollen aggregated into pollinia.</li>
<li><strong>Poaceae (Grasses) / Cyperaceae (Sedges) / Juncaceae (Rushes):</strong> Flowers highly reduced, wind-pollinated, lack showy petals. Grasses have open leaf sheaths; sedges often have triangular stems and closed sheaths; rushes have round stems and reduced flowers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of closed leaf sheath, 3 distinct sepals + 3 distinct petals, and often hairy/modified stamens is key for Commelinaceae.</p>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Commelinaceae is the largest family in the order Commelinales, which is part of the Commelinid clade – a major group within the monocots that also includes grasses (Poales), gingers (Zingiberales), and palms (Arecales). Commelinids are characterized by several features, including UV-fluorescent compounds in their cell walls (ferulic acid).</p>
<p>Within Commelinales, Commelinaceae is well-supported as monophyletic and is sister to the rest of the order, which includes smaller families like Pontederiaceae (Pickerel Weed family), Haemodoraceae (Bloodwort family), Philydraceae, and Hanguanaceae. Key evolutionary traits within Commelinaceae include the development of the closed leaf sheath, differentiation of the perianth into calyx and corolla, the striking diversity of stamen modifications (thought to be related to pollination strategies, potentially involving pollen deception or specialized rewards), and the evolution of ephemeral flowers.</p>

<h3>Related Families</h3>
<p>Within the order Commelinales, Commelinaceae is related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pontederiaceae</strong> (Pickerel Weed / Water Hyacinth family): Aquatic herbs, often with showy blue/purple zygomorphic flowers, superior ovary.</li>
<li><strong>Haemodoraceae</strong> (Bloodwort family): Herbs often with reddish rhizomes, 6 tepals, often an inferior ovary (<i>Haemodorum</i>) or superior (<i>Anigozanthos</i> - Kangaroo Paws).</li>
<li><strong>Philydraceae:</strong> Herbs of Australia/Asia with unique flower structure.</li>
<li><strong>Hanguanaceae:</strong> Robust herbs of SE Asia/Australia.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commelinales order is part of the Commelinid clade, related to other orders like Poales (Grasses, Sedges, Rushes), Zingiberales (Gingers, Bananas), and Arecales (Palms).</p>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Commelinaceae represents a significant radiation of primarily herbaceous monocots, particularly diverse in tropical regions. The family showcases key monocot traits (parallel venation, 3-merous flowers) but is distinguished within its order by the closed leaf sheath and differentiated perianth. The evolution of diverse and often complex stamen morphology within the family is a subject of interest regarding pollination biology, potentially involving pollen or nectar imitation by sterile or hairy structures. The ephemeral nature of the flowers is another striking adaptation, possibly reducing resource expenditure or coordinating with specific pollinator activity periods.</p>
