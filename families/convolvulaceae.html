<h1>Convolvulaceae</h1>
<p class="family-common-name">Morning Glory Family / Bindweed Family</p>
<p class="family-description">Convolvulaceae, the morning glory or bindweed family, comprises about 58 genera and roughly 1,800 species of eudicots in the order Solanales. The family is best known for its numerous twining herbaceous vines, typically bearing alternate leaves (often heart- or arrowhead-shaped) and showy, funnel-shaped flowers with 5 fused petals that are often pleated or twisted in bud. The family also includes shrubs, trees, and the unusual parasitic, leafless vines of the genus <i>Cuscuta</i> (dodders). The fruit is typically a capsule.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Distributed worldwide but most diverse in tropical and subtropical regions, the Convolvulaceae family includes species ranging from major food crops to beloved ornamentals and troublesome weeds. The most economically important member is the Sweet Potato (<i>Ipomoea batatas</i>), cultivated for its starchy tuberous roots. Many other <i>Ipomoea</i> species are grown as morning glories for their beautiful, often ephemeral flowers that typically open in the morning sun. Moonflowers (<i>Ipomoea alba</i>) have large white flowers that open at night.</p>
<p>However, the family also contains aggressive weeds like Field Bindweed (<i>Convolvulus arvensis</i>) and Hedge Bindweed (<i>Calystegia sepium</i>), which can be problematic in gardens and agriculture due to their persistent rhizomes and twining habit. A particularly unusual lineage within the family is the genus <i>Cuscuta</i> (dodders). These are parasitic plants lacking chlorophyll and significant leaves, appearing as yellow or orange thread-like stems that twine around host plants, extracting nutrients via specialized structures called haustoria. Some members of the family, particularly seeds of certain <i>Ipomoea</i>, contain ergoline alkaloids related to LSD and have been used historically in ritual contexts.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma (current location as of March 2025), common representatives include Field Bindweed (<i>Convolvulus arvensis</i>), native Hedge Bindweed (<i>Calystegia sepium</i>), various native and cultivated morning glories (<i>Ipomoea</i> species), and the non-vining Shaggy Dwarf Morning-Glory (<i>Evolvulus nuttallianus</i>).</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Predominantly twining or trailing herbaceous vines. Also includes erect herbs, shrubs, and small trees. Milky or clear latex is sometimes present. The genus <i>Cuscuta</i> consists of non-photosynthetic, parasitic vines with highly reduced vegetative structures, attaching to host plants via haustoria.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually simple and arranged alternately along the stem (rarely opposite). Leaf shape is often cordate (heart-shaped) or sagittate (arrowhead-shaped), but can also be linear, entire, lobed, or even palmately compound. Venation is typically pinnate or palmate. Stipules are absent. In <i>Cuscuta</i>, leaves are reduced to tiny, non-functional scales or are entirely absent.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Flowers are often borne solitary in the leaf axils or in few-flowered axillary clusters (cymes). Sometimes flowers are grouped into terminal or axillary heads, panicles, or racemes. Inflorescences are often subtended by bracts.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are typically bisexual, actinomorphic (radially symmetric), usually 5-merous, and often large and showy (except in <i>Cuscuta</i>). Key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Composed of 5 distinct (free) sepals, which are often unequal in size. The sepals are typically persistent in fruit and may sometimes enlarge.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Composed of 5 fused petals (sympetalous) forming a characteristic funnel-shaped (funnelform), bell-shaped (campanulate), or trumpet-shaped structure. A key feature is that the corolla is often plicate (having distinct vertical pleats or folds) and convolute (twisted) in bud, resulting in a star-like pattern or defined mid-petal areas when the flower opens. Colors are diverse (white, blue, purple, pink, red, yellow).</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens number 5, alternate with the corolla lobes, and are attached to the base of the corolla tube (epipetalous). Filaments are often unequal in length, and their bases may be hairy. Anthers dehisce via longitudinal slits.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> Ovary is superior, typically composed of 2 fused carpels (sometimes 3-5). It usually forms 2 locules (or 1, or 3-5), each containing typically 1 or 2 ovules attached near the base (basal-axile placentation). Style(s) are usually terminal, either single and undivided, single and branched, or rarely two distinct styles. Stigmas are variable in shape (capitate, globose, lobed, linear). A nectar disc is usually present around the base of the ovary.</li>
<li><strong><i>Cuscuta</i> Flowers:</strong> Small, often whitish or yellowish, typically 4- or 5-merous, with scale-like appendages (infrastaminal scales) often present inside the corolla tube below the stamens.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is most commonly a dry capsule that dehisces by splitting into valves (valvular), breaking apart irregularly, or sometimes opening via a circumscissile lid. Less often, the fruit is a fleshy berry or a hard, nut-like structure. Seeds are typically few (1-4 per fruit), often have a hard seed coat, and may be smooth or hairy. The embryo is often folded or coiled within the endosperm.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Many species contain resin glycosides (also called convolvulin glycosides). A significant feature is the presence of ergoline alkaloids (chemically related to LSD) in the seeds of several genera, particularly <i>Ipomoea</i>, <i>Argyreia</i>, and <i>Turbina</i>. Tropane alkaloids, characteristic of the related Solanaceae family, are generally absent. Milky latex occurs in some genera.</p>

<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Convolvulaceae often involves recognizing the vining habit, alternate leaves, and characteristic funnel-shaped flowers. The parasitic <i>Cuscuta</i> is unmistakable.</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twining/Trailing Habit:</strong> Most species are vines (herbaceous).</li>
<li><strong>Alternate, Simple Leaves:</strong> Leaves typically alternate, simple, often heart-shaped or arrowhead-shaped (except <i>Cuscuta</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Funnel-Shaped Corolla:</strong> Flowers usually large, with 5 fused petals forming a funnel or trumpet shape, often pleated/twisted in bud.</li>
<li><strong>5 Stamens Attached to Corolla:</strong> Stamens distinct, attached low inside the corolla tube.</li>
<li><strong>Superior Ovary:</strong> Ovary sits above the attachment of sepals/petals.</li>
<li><strong>Capsule Fruit:</strong> Fruit typically a dry capsule containing few seeds.</li>
<li><strong>For <i>Cuscuta</i>:</strong> Leafless, non-green (yellow/orange) parasitic vine twining on host plants, with small clustered flowers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Milky Latex:</strong> Sometimes present when stems/leaves are broken.</li>
<li><strong>Plicate/Convolute Corolla Bud:</strong> Twisted and folded appearance of the flower bud is characteristic.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Sepals:</strong> Sepals often remain (and may enlarge) around the fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Leaf Shape Details:</strong> Specific shape (cordate, sagittate, linear, lobed) can help distinguish species.</li>
<li><strong>Flower Color and Size:</strong> Aids in species identification.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summer/Fall:</strong> Peak flowering season for most morning glories and bindweeds. Flowers are best observed in the morning as many close in the afternoon heat.</li>
<li><strong>Growing Season:</strong> Vining stems and characteristic leaves are present.</li>
<li><strong>Summer/Fall (<i>Cuscuta</i>):</strong> Dodder becomes conspicuous as yellow/orange masses covering host vegetation, producing flowers and fruits.</li>
<li><i>(Current Time Context: Late March in Oklahoma - Too early for significant flowering of most native or weedy Convolvulaceae. Overwintering roots/rhizomes of perennials like bindweed may be present underground).</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Malvaceae (Mallow family):</strong> Some (<i>Hibiscus</i>) have large, showy flowers, but leaves often palmately lobed/veined, stamens fused into a column around the style, fruit often a schizocarp or differently structured capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Apocynaceae (Dogbane family):</strong> Some are vines (<i>Mandevilla</i>), but leaves usually opposite, often milky latex, flower structure differs (often salverform, may have corona), fruit usually paired follicles.</li>
<li><strong>Bignoniaceae (Trumpet Creeper family):</strong> Woody vines (<i>Campsis</i>) with trumpet-shaped flowers, but leaves usually opposite and compound, fruit a long capsule with winged seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Cucurbitaceae (Gourd family):</strong> Herbaceous vines, but climb with tendrils (usually), leaves often palmately lobed, flowers typically unisexual, ovary inferior.</li>
<li><strong>Polygonaceae (Buckwheat family):</strong> Some (<i>Fallopia</i>) are weedy vines, but have papery sheaths (ocrea) at nodes, small flowers usually lacking distinct large petals, fruit an achene.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key features for Convolvulaceae (excluding <i>Cuscuta</i>): Twining habit + Alternate leaves (often heart/arrowhead) + Funnelform/plicate corolla + 5 stamens + Superior ovary + Capsule fruit.</p>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Convolvulaceae belongs to the order Solanales, within the Lamiid clade of Asterids. Its closest relative within the order is the Solanaceae (Nightshade family), sharing features like fused petals, 5 stamens, and often superior ovaries, although differing significantly in chemistry (e.g., presence/absence of tropane vs. ergoline alkaloids) and fruit types.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the highly modified parasitic genus <i>Cuscuta</i> within Convolvulaceae is strongly supported by molecular data, indicating that parasitism evolved from autotrophic, vining ancestors within the family. The characteristic funnel-shaped, plicate corolla represents a key morphological synapomorphy for much of the family. The family exhibits considerable diversification in habit (from vines to trees) and adaptation to various environments.</p>
<div class="phylogeny-position">

</div>
<div class="related-families">
<h3>Related Families</h3>
<p>Within the order Solanales, Convolvulaceae is closely related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solanaceae</strong> (Nightshade family): Herbs, shrubs, trees, or vines. Often alternate leaves, 5-merous flowers often rotate or stellate (less commonly funnelform), superior ovary, fruit usually a berry or capsule. Characterized by tropane and other alkaloids.</li>
<li><strong>Montiniaceae:</strong> Small family of shrubs/trees in Africa/Madagascar.</li>
<li><strong>Sphenocleaceae:</strong> Small family with one genus (<i>Sphenoclea</i>) of wetland herbs.</li>
<li><strong>Hydroleaceae:</strong> Small family with one genus (<i>Hydrolea</i>) of herbs/subshrubs often in wet habitats.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Solanales order is part of the Lamiid clade, related to other orders like Lamiales (Mints, etc.), Gentianales (Gentians, Coffee, etc.), and Boraginales (Borages).</p>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Convolvulaceae exemplifies the successful evolutionary radiation of the twining vine habit among angiosperms. The development of the fused, funnel-shaped corolla, often with intricate folding (plication) and twisting (convolution) in bud, is a hallmark of the family and likely relates to pollination syndromes. The evolution of complete parasitism and drastic morphological reduction in <i>Cuscuta</i> from within a family of photosynthetic plants provides a fascinating case study in evolutionary transitions. The family's economic impact, through both the vital food crop sweet potato and problematic agricultural weeds, underscores its ecological and societal importance.</p>
