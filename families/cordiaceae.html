<h1>Cordiaceae</h1>
<p class="family-common-name">Cordia Family</p>
<p class="family-description">Cordiaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Boraginales, comprising approximately 350 species across several genera, with <i>Cordia</i> being the largest. These plants are characterized by their <strong>woody habit</strong> as trees or shrubs, <strong>alternate, simple leaves</strong> that are often rough or scabrous, and <strong>distinctive inflorescences</strong> that are typically cymose or paniculate. The flowers have a tubular calyx, a funnel-shaped or bell-shaped corolla with 4-5 lobes, and a superior ovary that develops into a <strong>drupe fruit</strong> with a hard endocarp. The family has a <strong>pantropical distribution</strong>, with species occurring in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, particularly in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, where they grow in various habitats from rainforests to dry woodlands.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Cordiaceae family comprises a diverse group of woody flowering plants that were previously included in the Boraginaceae family but are now recognized as a distinct family based on molecular and morphological evidence. The family name is derived from the genus <i>Cordia</i>, which was named in honor of Euricius Cordus and his son Valerius Cordus, German botanists and pharmacologists of the 16th century.</p>
<p>Cordiaceae has a <strong>pantropical distribution</strong>, with species occurring in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The greatest diversity is found in the Neotropics, particularly in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Different species have adapted to various habitats, ranging from humid rainforests to dry woodlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Members of this family are ecologically important as components of tropical forest ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various animals. Many species produce edible fruits that are consumed by birds and mammals, which disperse the seeds. Several Cordiaceae species have economic importance as sources of timber, ornamental plants, food (fruits), and traditional medicines. Some species, particularly in the genus <i>Cordia</i>, are valued for their hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Members of Cordiaceae are <strong>woody plants</strong> that may be trees, shrubs, or occasionally lianas. They range from small shrubs to large trees reaching 30 meters or more in height. The bark is typically rough and fissured in mature specimens. The wood is often hard and dense, with distinctive grain patterns in some species. The branches frequently have a characteristic zigzag growth pattern, especially in the distal portions.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>The leaves of Cordiaceae are <strong>simple, alternate, and without stipules</strong>. They are typically ovate to elliptic in shape with entire or serrate margins. A distinctive feature is the often <strong>rough or scabrous texture</strong> of the leaf surface, which is covered with stiff trichomes (hairs) that give the leaves a sandpaper-like feel in many species. The venation is usually pinnate, with the secondary veins often prominent. The leaves may be deciduous or evergreen, depending on the species and habitat.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Reproductive Structures</h3>
<p>The inflorescences are typically <strong>cymose or paniculate</strong>, often with a distinctive structure where the flowers are arranged on one side of the branches (scorpioid cymes). The flowers are usually bisexual (though some species are dioecious) and have a tubular calyx with 3-5 lobes or teeth. The corolla is funnel-shaped or bell-shaped, with 4-5 lobes, and is typically white, yellow, orange, or red. The androecium consists of 4-5 stamens attached to the corolla tube, and the gynoecium has a superior ovary with 2-4 carpels and a terminal style that is often forked. The fruit is a <strong>drupe</strong> with a fleshy mesocarp and a hard, bony endocarp (stone) that contains 1-4 seeds. The persistent calyx often enlarges and becomes papery or fleshy in fruit, sometimes forming a cup around the base of the drupe.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Anatomical Features</h3>
<p>Anatomically, Cordiaceae species often have <strong>distinctive wood structure</strong> with storied rays and axial parenchyma. The leaves typically have cystoliths (mineral concretions) in specialized cells, which contribute to their rough texture. The trichomes on the leaf surface are often of various types, including simple, stellate, or glandular, and their morphology can be useful for species identification.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Distinguishing Features</h3>
<p>Cordiaceae can be distinguished from other plant families by a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Woody habit (trees or shrubs)</li>
<li>Alternate, simple leaves with rough or scabrous texture</li>
<li>Cymose or paniculate inflorescences, often scorpioid</li>
<li>Tubular calyx and funnel-shaped or bell-shaped corolla</li>
<li>Drupe fruits with a hard endocarp, often with persistent calyx</li>
</ul>

<h2>Identification</h2>
<div class="identification-content">
<h3>Field Identification Tips</h3>
<p>When trying to identify members of the Cordiaceae family in the field, look for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth habit:</strong> Woody trees or shrubs, often with zigzag branching pattern</li>
<li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Alternate, simple, often with rough or sandpaper-like texture</li>
<li><strong>Inflorescence:</strong> Cymose or paniculate, often with flowers arranged on one side of the branches</li>
<li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Tubular calyx, funnel-shaped or bell-shaped corolla with 4-5 lobes</li>
<li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Drupes, often with persistent calyx that may be enlarged or modified</li>
</ul>
<h3>Similar Families</h3>
<p>Cordiaceae may be confused with several other plant families:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boraginaceae:</strong> Closely related family but typically herbaceous with different fruit types</li>
<li><strong>Ehretiaceae:</strong> Another closely related family with similar woody habit but different inflorescence and fruit structure</li>
<li><strong>Lamiaceae:</strong> Some members have similar leaf texture but typically with square stems, opposite leaves, and different floral structure</li>
<li><strong>Verbenaceae:</strong> Similar growth habit in some genera but with opposite leaves and different fruit structure</li>
</ul>
<h3>Distinguishing Features</h3>
<p>The most reliable features for distinguishing Cordiaceae from similar families include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leaf arrangement and texture:</strong> Alternate leaves with rough texture</li>
<li><strong>Inflorescence structure:</strong> Cymose or paniculate, often scorpioid</li>
<li><strong>Fruit type:</strong> Drupe with hard endocarp and persistent calyx</li>
<li><strong>Wood anatomy:</strong> Distinctive storied rays and axial parenchyma (requires microscopic examination)</li>
</ul>
<p>For definitive identification, examination of the <strong>flower structure</strong> and <strong>fruit type</strong> is often necessary, as these features are the most diagnostic for the family.</p>

<h3>Phylogenetic Note</h3>
<p>Cordiaceae has undergone significant taxonomic revisions based on molecular phylogenetic studies. Traditionally, the genera now included in this family were placed in Boraginaceae in a broad sense. However, molecular evidence has supported the recognition of Cordiaceae as a distinct family within the Boraginales order. The family is most closely related to Ehretiaceae, with which it shares the woody habit and drupe fruits, though there are significant differences in inflorescence structure and other morphological features. The genus <i>Varronia</i>, which was previously included in <i>Cordia</i>, has been recognized as distinct based on molecular and morphological evidence, particularly its head-like inflorescences and different pollen morphology. This taxonomic history illustrates the ongoing refinement of our understanding of plant relationships as new evidence emerges from molecular studies.</p>
