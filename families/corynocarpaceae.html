<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Corynocarpaceae is a monotypic family (containing only the genus <i><strong>Corynocarpus</strong></i> with about 5 species) belonging to the order <strong>Cucurbitales</strong>, within the Fabid clade of Rosids. This small family of evergreen <strong>trees and shrubs</strong> has a restricted distribution in the Southwest Pacific area, including New Guinea, northeastern Australia (Queensland), New Caledonia, Vanuatu, and New Zealand. It is not found in the Americas, Africa, or mainland Asia.</p>
<p>Plants in this family are recognized by their <strong>alternate, simple leaves</strong> which are typically large, leathery, and have entire margins. A key vegetative feature is the presence of relatively large <strong>stipules</strong> that are often fused (intrapetiolar) or rolled (convolute) and protect the terminal bud; these stipules fall off early, leaving distinctive <strong>annular scars</strong> that encircle the twig at each node. The flowers are small, radially symmetrical, 5-merous, and borne in terminal or axillary panicles. Florally, they are distinguished by having <strong>5 fertile stamens</strong> that alternate with <strong>5 prominent, often petal-like staminodes</strong> (sterile stamens), all situated around a nectar disk at the base of the superior ovary. The ovary typically functions as if single-loculed and develops into a large, fleshy <strong>drupe</strong> containing a single seed.</p>
<p>The seeds of <i>Corynocarpus</i> are well-known for containing the potent neurotoxin <strong>karakin</strong> (a nitro compound), making them highly poisonous if ingested raw. However, the kernels of <i>Corynocarpus laevigatus</i> (Karaka) were a traditional food source for Māori in New Zealand after extensive and careful preparation involving cooking and soaking to remove the toxin. The family has little other economic importance but is botanically interesting due to its unique features and phylogenetic placement.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Evergreen <strong>trees</strong> or <strong>shrubs</strong> with smooth bark.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are arranged <strong>alternately</strong> and spirally. They are <strong>simple</strong>, petiolate, relatively large, often leathery (coriaceous), and typically have <strong>entire margins</strong>. Venation is pinnate. A distinctive feature is the presence of conspicuous <strong>stipules</strong> which are intrapetiolar (fused between petiole and stem) or convolute (rolled), forming a cap over the terminal bud. These stipules are deciduous (fall off early), leaving prominent <strong>annular (ring-like) scars</strong> encircling the stem at the nodes.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Inflorescences are usually terminal or axillary, relatively large, branched <strong>panicles</strong>, sometimes appearing raceme-like. Bracts are small and caducous.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are small (usually 4-8 mm diameter), actinomorphic (radially symmetrical), bisexual (perfect), and typically 5-merous. They are often greenish-white, cream, or yellowish.</p> <ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Consists of 5 sepals, fused shortly at the base, with imbricate (overlapping) lobes. Persistent in fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Consists of 5 petals, free (distinct), alternating with the sepals, often slightly larger than sepals, inserted at the base of the nectar disk. Imbricate in bud.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Characteristically consists of two whorls: an outer whorl of <strong>5 fertile stamens</strong> alternating with the petals, and an inner whorl of <strong>5 prominent staminodes</strong> alternating with the fertile stamens (i.e., opposite the petals). The staminodes are often petal-like or toothed. Both stamens and staminodes are inserted at the base of or on a fleshy, lobed nectar disk that surrounds the ovary base. Fertile stamens have short filaments and basifixed anthers opening via longitudinal slits.</li> <li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> The ovary is <strong>superior</strong>, composed of theoretically 2 (sometimes reported as 1 or 3) fused carpels, but typically functions as if <strong>1-locular</strong> due to the suppression/abortion of the second carpel/locule. The functional locule contains a single pendulous, anatropous ovule attached near the apex. Styles are 1 or 2, free or fused at the base; stigmas are small, capitate.</li> </ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is a relatively large (typically 2-4 cm long), ovoid or ellipsoid, fleshy <strong>drupe</strong>. The exocarp is smooth, often brightly colored (orange, red, purple, or yellowish). The mesocarp is fleshy, and the endocarp (stone) is hard, enclosing a single large seed. The seed completely lacks endosperm; the embryo is large with thick, fleshy, plano-convex cotyledons. The seed kernel contains the toxin <strong>karakin</strong> and is highly poisonous unless properly detoxified.</p> </div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>The most notable chemical feature is the presence of the toxic nitro Toxin <strong>karakin</strong> (a glucoside of 3-nitropropionic acid) in the seeds and to a lesser extent in fruits/leaves. Tannins are also present. Unlike many other Cucurbitales families (like Cucurbitaceae), they lack cucurbitacins. Silica bodies are generally absent.</p> </div>

<div class="container">
<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Corynocarpaceae (<i>Corynocarpus</i>) relies on recognizing the combination of alternate entire leaves with distinctive stipule scars, the unique flower structure (5 stamens + 5 staminodes), the large drupe fruit, and its restricted SW Pacific distribution.</p> <div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Evergreen tree or shrub.</li>
<li><strong>Alternate, Simple, Entire Leaves:</strong> Often large and leathery.</li>
<li><strong>Large Deciduous Stipules leaving Annular Scars:</strong> Look for ring-like scars encircling the twig at each node where the bud-enclosing stipules have fallen.</li>
<li><strong>Flowers with 5 Stamens + 5 Staminodes:</strong> Small, 5-merous flowers with this specific androecial structure around a disk.</li>
<li><strong>Superior Ovary (Functionally 1-locular):</strong> Ovary positioned above other floral parts.</li>
<li><strong>Large Fleshy Drupe Fruit:</strong> Often orange or reddish, containing a single large poisonous seed.</li>
<li><strong>Restricted SW Pacific Distribution:</strong> Native range limited to NE Australia, New Guinea, NZ, and nearby islands.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flowers small, actinomorphic, in panicles.</li>
<li>5 distinct petals present.</li>
<li>Seed kernel known to be poisonous (karakin).</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year-Round:</strong> Evergreen leaves, tree/shrub habit, and especially the characteristic annular stipule scars on twigs are visible year-round.</li>
<li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Panicles of small flowers appear seasonally. Check for the 5 stamens + 5 staminodes structure.</li>
<li><strong>Fruiting Season:</strong> Large, colorful drupes mature seasonally and are highly diagnostic.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other Tropical Trees with Alternate Simple Leaves:</strong> Many families fit this description (e.g., Lauraceae, Annonaceae, Sapotaceae, some Euphorbiaceae). Key distinguishing features for Corynocarpaceae are the prominent <strong>annular stipule scars</strong>, the specific flower structure (<strong>5 stamens + 5 staminodes</strong>), superior ovary, and the large <strong>drupe</strong> fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Pittosporaceae:</strong> Some <i>Pittosporum</i> species are trees/shrubs with alternate simple entire leaves, but they lack the distinctive stipule scars, have different flowers (often 5 stamens only, superior ovary often multi-locular), and fruit is usually a capsule with sticky seeds. (Order Apiales).</li>
<li><strong>Myrsinaceae/Primulaceae (e.g., <i>Ardisia</i>):</strong> Shrubs/trees with alternate simple leaves, but typically lack stipules or have different types, flowers often sympetalous (fused petals) or different structure, fruit usually a drupe or berry but floral details differ. (Order Ericales).</li>
<li>The annular stipule scars are perhaps the most useful vegetative character for recognizing <i>Corynocarpus</i>.</li>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Corynocarpaceae, containing only the genus <i>Corynocarpus</i>, belongs to the order <strong>Cucurbitales</strong> within the Fabid clade of Rosids. This placement is robustly supported by molecular phylogenetic studies, although its exact position within the order remains somewhat uncertain and has varied slightly between different analyses.</p>
<p>Cucurbitales is an order known for including families with predominantly inferior ovaries (like Cucurbitaceae, Begoniaceae) and often parietal placentation. Corynocarpaceae, with its superior ovary and single apical ovule, appears somewhat anomalous morphologically within the order. Molecular data sometimes place it sister to Coriariaceae (another family with unusual features like apocarpy and a disjunct distribution, also in Cucurbitales), or potentially near Anisophylleaceae. It represents a distinct, isolated lineage within the broader Cucurbitales radiation.</p> <div class="phylogeny-position">

</ul>
</div>
<div class="related-families (Order Cucurbitales)">
<h3>Related Families</h3>
<p>As a member of the order Cucurbitales, Corynocarpaceae is related to several other mostly tropical or subtropical families:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cucurbitaceae</strong> (Gourd, Squash, Melon family): Mostly vines with tendrils, palmately lobed leaves, unisexual flowers usually with inferior ovary, fruit a pepo.</li>
<li><strong>Begoniaceae</strong> (Begonia family): Mostly succulent herbs/subshrubs, often asymmetric leaves, unisexual flowers with inferior ovary (often winged), fruit usually a capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Coriariaceae</strong> (Coriaria family): Shrubs/subshrubs, opposite/whorled leaves mimicking compound, apocarpous superior ovary, fruit achenes enclosed by fleshy petals (pseudo-drupe). Highly disjunct.</li>
<li><strong>Anisophylleaceae:</strong> Tropical trees/shrubs, often asymmetric leaves, small flowers, inferior ovary, fruit a drupe or samara.</li>
<li><strong>Datiscaceae:</strong> Herbs/trees, compound leaves, unisexual flowers, inferior ovary, capsule fruit. Nitrogen-fixing (<i>Frankia</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Tetramelaceae:</strong> Large tropical trees, alternate simple leaves, unisexual flowers, inferior ovary, capsule fruit.</li>
</ul> </div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Corynocarpaceae, though small, is evolutionarily interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phylogenetic Placement:</strong> Its firm position within Cucurbitales, despite morphological differences (e.g., superior ovary), highlights the importance of molecular data in understanding deep evolutionary relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Biogeography:</strong> Its restricted distribution in the SW Pacific/Australasia provides data for understanding the historical assembly and diversification of floras in this region, potentially linked to Gondwanan history or Cenozoic dispersal.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Floral Morphology:</strong> The presence of a distinct whorl of 5 petaloid staminodes alternating with the 5 fertile stamens is an unusual floral feature.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Defense:</strong> The evolution of the potent nitro Toxin karakin represents a specialized chemical defense mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Isolated Lineage:</strong> Represents a relatively isolated and morphologically distinct lineage within the Cucurbitales order.</li>
