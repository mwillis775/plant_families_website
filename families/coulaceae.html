<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Coulaceae is a monotypic family of flowering plants in the order Santalales, containing a single species, <i>Coula edulis</i>, commonly known as African walnut or Gabonese walnut. This evergreen tree is endemic to tropical West and Central Africa, particularly Gabon, Cameroon, Congo, and neighboring countries, where it grows in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>The taxonomic history of Coulaceae has been complex and subject to considerable revision. The genus <i>Coula</i> was first described by Henri Ernest Baillon in 1862, and the species <i>C. edulis</i> was named for its edible nuts. For many years, <i>Coula</i> was placed in the family Olacaceae. However, molecular phylogenetic studies in the early 21st century led to a major reorganization of the Santalales order, resulting in the recognition of Coulaceae as a distinct monotypic family.</p>
<p>In the APG IV classification system (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group), Coulaceae is recognized as a distinct family within Santalales. It occupies a position near the base of the order, being one of the earlier-diverging lineages. This position is particularly interesting because most other families in Santalales include parasitic or hemiparasitic plants, while <i>Coula edulis</i> is non-parasitic (autotrophic).</p>
<p><i>Coula edulis</i> is a medium-sized tree, typically growing to about 15-25 meters tall, with simple, alternate leaves and small, bisexual flowers arranged in racemes. The fruits are distinctive nut-like structures with a hard, woody shell containing an edible kernel. These nuts, known as African or Gabonese walnuts, are an important food source for both humans and wildlife in the tree's native range.</p>
<p>The nuts of <i>Coula edulis</i> have significant economic importance in West and Central Africa. They are harvested from the wild and sold in local markets, providing both food and income for rural communities. The nuts have a rich, oily flavor somewhat similar to European walnuts (<i>Juglans regia</i>) or hazelnuts (<i>Corylus</i> species), though they are not closely related to either. They can be eaten raw or cooked and are used in various traditional dishes.</p>
<p>Beyond its edible nuts, <i>Coula edulis</i> is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used for construction, furniture-making, and other purposes. The tree also has ecological importance as a component of African rainforest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various animals, including elephants, which play a role in seed dispersal.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p><i>Coula edulis</i>, the sole member of Coulaceae, is a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medium-sized evergreen tree, typically growing to about 15-25 meters tall</li>
<li>Often with a somewhat spreading crown</li>
<li>Trunk typically straight, reaching up to 50-80 cm in diameter</li>
<li>Bark typically grayish to brownish, somewhat rough</li>
</ul>
<p>It typically grows in lowland tropical rainforests across its range in West and Central Africa. Unlike many other members of the Santalales order, <i>Coula edulis</i> is non-parasitic (autotrophic), obtaining nutrients through photosynthesis rather than parasitizing other plants.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>The leaves of <i>Coula edulis</i> have several distinctive characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arrangement:</strong> Alternate along the stems</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Simple, never compound</li>
<li><strong>Margins:</strong> Entire (smooth, without teeth or lobes)</li>
<li><strong>Shape:</strong> Typically elliptic to oblong</li>
<li><strong>Size:</strong> Medium to large, typically 10-20 cm long and 4-8 cm wide</li>
<li><strong>Texture:</strong> Somewhat leathery (coriaceous)</li>
<li><strong>Venation:</strong> Pinnate, with a prominent midrib and less conspicuous secondary veins</li>
<li><strong>Stipules:</strong> Absent</li>
</ul>
<p>The leaves are typically glabrous (smooth, without hairs) and often somewhat glossy on the upper surface. The simple, alternate leaves with entire margins are consistent with the tree's position in the Santalales order and help distinguish it from some unrelated trees with similar growth habits.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">

<p>The flowers of <i>Coula edulis</i> are relatively inconspicuous but provide key diagnostic features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arrangement:</strong> In axillary racemes</li>
<li><strong>Size:</strong> Small, typically less than 1 cm in diameter</li>
<li><strong>Sexual system:</strong> Bisexual (hermaphroditic)</li>
<li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> Actinomorphic (radially symmetrical)</li>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Small, cup-shaped, often with 4-5 lobes or teeth</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> 4-5 petals, free or partially fused, often yellowish to greenish</li>
<li><strong>Stamens:</strong> Typically 8-10, in two whorls</li>
<li><strong>Ovary:</strong> Superior to half-inferior, typically with 3-4 locules (chambers)</li>
<li><strong>Style:</strong> Simple, with a lobed stigma</li>
</ul>
<p>The floral structure, particularly the arrangement of stamens in two whorls and the partially locular ovary, is characteristic of the species and reflects its position in the Santalales order.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>After pollination, the flowers develop into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fruit type:</strong> A nut-like drupe with a hard, woody endocarp (shell)</li>
<li><strong>Fruit shape:</strong> Somewhat globose (spherical) to ovoid</li>
<li><strong>Fruit size:</strong> Typically 3-5 cm in diameter</li>
<li><strong>Fruit color:</strong> Brownish when ripe</li>
<li><strong>Kernel:</strong> Single, large, edible, rich in oils</li>
<li><strong>Seed dispersal:</strong> Primarily by gravity and animals, particularly elephants and other large mammals that consume the fruits and disperse the seeds</li>
</ul>
<p>The distinctive nut-like fruits with a hard, woody shell containing an edible kernel are a key feature of <i>Coula edulis</i> and give rise to its common name, African walnut. These nuts are an important food source for both humans and wildlife in the tree's native range.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">

<h3>Phylogenetic Note</h3>
<p>The phylogenetic position of Coulaceae has been clarified through molecular phylogenetic studies in the early 21st century. These studies have led to a major reorganization of the Santalales order, with Coulaceae now recognized as a distinct monotypic family occupying a position near the base of the order.</p>
<p>Coulaceae is particularly interesting from an evolutionary perspective because it is one of the earlier-diverging lineages in Santalales, an order that includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. <i>Coula edulis</i>, however, is non-parasitic (autotrophic), suggesting that the ancestral condition in Santalales was non-parasitic, with parasitism evolving later in the order's history.</p>
<p>The family is most closely related to Erythropalaceae, Strombosiaceae, and Olacaceae, with which it shares various morphological features, including similar leaf arrangements, floral structures, and some aspects of fruit development. These families, along with several others, were previously included in a more broadly defined Olacaceae. Molecular studies have shown that this traditional circumscription was polyphyletic (derived from multiple ancestral lineages), leading to the recognition of several distinct families.</p>
<p>The monotypic nature of Coulaceae, containing only <i>Coula edulis</i>, is interesting from an evolutionary perspective. It suggests that this lineage may have once been more diverse but has experienced extinction, leaving only a single surviving species. Alternatively, it may represent a relatively recent evolutionary innovation that has not yet diversified. The restricted distribution of <i>C. edulis</i> in West and Central Africa suggests a relatively recent origin, possibly associated with the evolution of African rainforests.</p>
<p>The distinctive nut-like fruits of <i>C. edulis</i>, with their hard, woody shells and edible kernels, represent a specialized adaptation that is unusual in the Santalales order. This fruit type is likely an adaptation for seed dispersal by large mammals, particularly elephants, which consume the fruits and disperse the seeds. The hard shell protects the seed during passage through the digestive tract, while the nutritious kernel provides a reward for the disperser.</p>
<p>The family's position near the base of Santalales makes it particularly valuable for understanding the evolution of this diverse and ecologically important order, which includes not only non-parasitic plants but also various types of parasitic plants, from root parasites to stem parasites to the extreme reduction seen in some mistletoes.</p>
