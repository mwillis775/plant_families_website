<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Cunoniaceae family comprises around 27-30 genera and 300-350 species of woody plants. Its distribution pattern strongly reflects Gondwanan origins, with centers of diversity in Australia, New Caledonia, New Guinea, New Zealand, southern South America, Madagascar, and Southern Africa. Members range from small shrubs to large forest trees.</p>
<p>Key distinguishing features include the typically opposite, compound leaves with toothed margins and often large, conspicuous stipules (especially interpetiolar ones). The flowers are usually small and clustered, and the fruit is most commonly a capsule. The family belongs to the order <strong>Oxalidales</strong>.</p>
<p>Ecologically, Cunoniaceae are important components of many Southern Hemisphere ecosystems, particularly in wet forests and montane environments. Some species are valued for timber (e.g., <i>Weinmannia</i>, <i>Caldcluvia</i>), while others have horticultural significance (e.g., <i>Ceratopetalum</i>, <i>Eucryphia</i>).</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Members are predominantly <strong>trees or shrubs</strong>, ranging from small shrubs to large canopy trees. Some species can be lianas or scrambling shrubs. Most are evergreen.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually arranged <strong>oppositely</strong>, though sometimes whorled or alternate. They are typically <strong>compound</strong> (pinnate, trifoliate, or sometimes reduced to a single leaflet - unifoliate), rarely simple. Leaflet margins are commonly <strong>serrated or toothed</strong>. A hallmark of the family is the presence of <strong>stipules</strong>, which are often conspicuous, frequently <strong>interpetiolar</strong> (located between the petioles of opposite leaves), sometimes fused into a single structure, occasionally large and leaf-like (e.g., <i>Ackama</i>), or sometimes small and falling early but leaving distinct scars.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Flowers are borne in various types of inflorescences, often forming dense clusters. Common types include <strong>panicles, racemes, heads, or cymes</strong>, usually located terminally or in the upper leaf axils.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are generally small, numerous, and <strong>radially symmetrical</strong> (actinomorphic). They are typically <strong>bisexual</strong>, although some species have unisexual flowers (plants may be dioecious or polygamous). Flowers are usually <strong>4- or 5-merous</strong> (parts in fours or fives), but variation exists (3-10 parts).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> 4 or 5 sepals, usually free or slightly fused at the base, typically persistent in fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> 4 or 5 petals, free, often small and inconspicuous, sometimes absent (<strong>apetalous</strong>, e.g., some <i>Weinmannia</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens usually number twice the sepals or petals (<strong>8 or 10</strong>), sometimes more numerous. Filaments are free, arising from a nectar disc or the rim of a hypanthium.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> The ovary is usually <strong>superior</strong> (sometimes half-inferior), typically composed of <strong>2 carpels</strong> (ranging from 2 to 5, rarely more), which can be fused or sometimes free. Each carpel usually has two or more ovules. Styles are typically free and often persist on the fruit. A nectar-producing <strong>disc</strong> is commonly present around the base of the ovary.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The most common fruit type is a <strong>capsule</strong>, typically small, woody or leathery, splitting open along the septa (septicidal) or locules (loculicidal). Less commonly, the fruit may be a follicle, nut, drupe, or berry. Seeds are generally small and numerous, sometimes equipped with wings or hairs to aid in wind dispersal.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Many species are known to be rich in <strong>tannins</strong>, contributing to their use in traditional medicine or tanning. They are also often <strong>aluminum accumulators</strong>. Saponins and iridoid compounds have been reported in some genera.</p>

<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Cunoniaceae in the field often relies on recognizing a combination of vegetative features, especially leaf and stipule characteristics:</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposite, compound leaves:</strong> Look for leaves arranged in pairs, typically divided into leaflets (pinnate or trifoliate common).</li>
<li><strong>Serrated leaflet margins:</strong> The edges of the leaflets are usually toothed.</li>
<li><strong>Conspicuous stipules or stipule scars:</strong> Check the node between the petioles for stipules (often interpetiolar, sometimes large or fused) or the scars they leave behind if they have fallen.</li>
<li><strong>Small flowers in dense clusters:</strong> Inflorescences are typically composed of many small, often whitish or cream-colored flowers.</li>
<li><strong>Capsular fruit (common):</strong> Look for small, often 2-parted capsules, frequently with persistent styles.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tree or shrub habit:</strong> Most members are woody plants.</li>
<li><strong>Southern Hemisphere distribution:</strong> Primarily found in specific regions of the Southern Hemisphere, often in moist forest or montane habitats.</li>
<li><strong>Tannin presence:</strong> Broken leaves or bark might have an astringent quality.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<p>Vegetative features are useful year-round for these mostly evergreen plants:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year-round:</strong> Opposite leaves, compound structure, serrated margins, and especially the presence/scars of stipules are key vegetative clues.</li>
<li><strong>Flowering/Fruiting Season:</strong> Provides definitive characteristics but flowers are small. Look for dense clusters. Persistent capsules or remnants might be found outside the main fruiting season.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<p>Distinguishing Cunoniaceae from other families with opposite, compound leaves requires careful attention to detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sapindaceae (some genera):</strong> Some maples (<i>Acer</i>) have opposite, compound leaves but typically lack stipules and have distinct winged samara fruits.</li>
<li><strong>Bignoniaceae (some genera):</strong> May have opposite, compound leaves, but often have large, showy, tubular flowers and long capsule fruits with winged seeds, and usually lack stipules (or have pseudostipules).</li>
<li><strong>Oleaceae (e.g., <i>Fraxinus</i> - Ash):</strong> Have opposite, pinnately compound leaves but lack stipules and have distinct samara fruits. Flowers differ significantly (often reduced).</li>
<li><strong>Staphyleaceae (Bladdernut family):</strong> Opposite, trifoliate/pinnate leaves, often serrated, stipules present but small/falling early. Distinctive inflated capsule fruit.</li>
<li><i>Focus on the combination:</i> Opposite + Compound + Serrated + Conspicuous Stipules (especially Interpetiolar) + Small Flowers/Capsule Fruit points strongly towards Cunoniaceae.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Cunoniaceae is firmly placed within the order <strong>Oxalidales</strong>, part of the Fabid clade of rosid eudicots. The order Oxalidales itself contains a somewhat morphologically diverse group of families, united primarily by molecular data.</p>
<p>Within Oxalidales, Cunoniaceae represents a significant lineage, particularly notable for its woody habit and extensive radiation in the Southern Hemisphere. Its sister group relationships are still debated but likely involve families such as Oxalidaceae, Connaraceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Brunelliaceae, and Cephalotaceae. The family's distribution and diversity are strongly linked to the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana.</p>
