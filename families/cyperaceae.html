<h1>Cyperaceae</h1>
<p class="guide-description"> Cyperaceae, the sedge family, is a large and ecologically significant family of monocots in the order Poales (Commelinid clade), comprising about 100 genera and over 5,500 species. These grass-like herbs are found worldwide, especially dominating wetlands, marshes, and moist temperate or boreal regions. They are typically characterized by stems (culms) that are often triangular in cross-section and solid (not hollow), leaves usually arranged in three ranks with closed sheaths, and highly reduced, wind-pollinated flowers (florets) borne in complex inflorescences of spikelets. The fruit is a single-seeded achene (or nutlet).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Often overlooked or confused with grasses (Poaceae) or rushes (Juncaceae), the Cyperaceae family is a major component of many ecosystems, particularly wetlands where they provide critical habitat, food for wildlife, and play roles in water filtration and soil stabilization. The family is cosmopolitan, thriving from the tropics to the arctic tundra. Key genera include the immense genus <i>Carex</i> (true sedges, &gt;2000 species), <i>Cyperus</i> (flatsedges, galingales, including papyrus <i>C. papyrus</i>), <i>Eleocharis</i> (spike-rushes), and various groups commonly called bulrushes (<i>Scirpus</i>, <i>Schoenoplectus</i>, <i>Bolboschoenus</i>).</p>
<p>Direct economic importance is less pronounced than in grasses, but significant uses exist. Papyrus (<i>Cyperus papyrus</i>) was historically vital for paper production in ancient Egypt. Various species are used locally for weaving mats, baskets, and thatch. Some provide minor food sources (e.g., tubers of <i>Cyperus esculentus</i> - Yellow Nutsedge or Chufa, though often considered a weed). However, many species are problematic weeds in agriculture, turf, and wetlands (<i>Cyperus rotundus</i> - Purple Nutsedge, is considered one of the world's worst weeds).</p>
<p>A classic mnemonic helps distinguish the three major grass-like monocot families: "Sedges have edges (often triangular stems), Rushes are round (round stems), Grasses have nodes/joints (swollen nodes on hollow/solid stems)". Key Cyperaceae features are the often triangular, solid stems and 3-ranked leaves with closed sheaths. Oklahoma (current location as of March 27, 2025) has a rich native sedge flora, with numerous species of <i>Carex</i>, <i>Cyperus</i>, <i>Eleocharis</i>, <i>Scirpus</i>, <i>Rhynchospora</i>, and others found particularly in moist prairies, woodlands, marshes, and along water bodies.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group"> <h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Mostly perennial herbs, often grass-like in appearance, typically growing from rhizomes or stolons, frequently forming dense clumps (cespitose) or extensive colonies (turf). Some species are annual.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Stems (Culms)</h3>
<p>Aerial stems (culms) are characteristically <b>solid</b> (filled with pith, not hollow like most grasses) and often <b>triangular</b> in cross-section ("sedges have edges"), though round or flattened culms also occur. Nodes are generally not swollen.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are typically arranged in <b>three ranks</b> (tristichous) along the base of the culm or along elongated vegetative stems. They consist of a <b>closed sheath</b> that encircles the culm (unlike the typically open sheath with overlapping margins in grasses) and a simple, linear blade with parallel venation. A ligule (appendage at the sheath/blade junction) may be present or absent. Basal leaves are common; culm leaves may be present or reduced/absent (<i>Eleocharis</i>).</p>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram showing triangular stem and 3-ranked leaves with closed sheath" src="../img/guides/cyperaceae-stem-leaf.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Characteristic Cyperaceae features: Often triangular solid stem, 3-ranked leaves with closed sheaths.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>The basic unit of the inflorescence is the <b>spikelet</b>. Each spikelet contains one to many small flowers (florets), typically arranged spirally or distichously along a central axis (rachilla), with each floret subtended by a single scale-like bract (often called a floral scale or glume). Spikelets themselves are variously aggregated into larger inflorescences, such as single or multiple spikes, racemes, panicles, or dense head-like clusters (capitula). These larger inflorescences are often subtended by one or more leaf-like or scale-like involucral bracts.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers (Florets)</h3>
<p>Flowers are small, inconspicuous, highly reduced, and typically wind-pollinated (anemophilous). They are usually bisexual, but can be unisexual (plants then monoecious or dioecious, especially important in <i>Carex</i>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perianth:<i></i> Absent, or reduced to bristles, hairs, or small scales (typically 0-6 or more) located below the ovary and stamens. These persistent bristles can aid in fruit dispersal or identification.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Androecium:<i></i> Stamens usually 3 (sometimes 1, 2, or rarely 6+). Filaments are slender; anthers are typically basifixed (attached at the base) and dehisce via longitudinal slits.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:<i></i> Ovary is superior, composed of typically 2 or 3 fused carpels, forming a single locule (chamber) containing a single basal ovule. A single style arises from the ovary apex, bearing 2 or 3 elongated, often feathery or papillose stigma branches (the number usually matches the carpel number and predicts the fruit shape).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Specialization in <i>Carex</i>:<b> Flowers are strictly unisexual. The female flower (pistil) is uniquely enclosed within a sac-like or flask-shaped bractlet called the </b>perigynium<i></i> (or utricle). Only the style and stigmas protrude from the perigynium opening. The male flower typically consists of just 3 stamens subtended by a floral scale. Male and female spikelets can be separate or combined in various arrangements within the same inflorescence.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram of typical Cyperaceae floret and Carex perigynium" src="../img/guides/cyperaceae-floret-carex.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Left: Generalized Cyperaceae floret with scale, reduced perianth (bristles), stamens, superior ovary with styles. Right: <i>Carex</i> female flower enclosed in perigynium.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is characteristically a single-seeded, dry, indehiscent fruit called an <b>achene</b> (or sometimes nutlet). The shape of the achene is often diagnostic and typically reflects the number of carpels/stigmas: lens-shaped (biconvex) if derived from a 2-carpellate ovary (2 stigmas), or triangular in cross-section (trigonous) if derived from a 3-carpellate ovary (3 stigmas). The achene may be naked, subtended by persistent perianth bristles, or enclosed within the perigynium (<i>Carex</i>). The seed contains starchy endosperm and a small embryo.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Silica bodies are present in epidermal cells. Various secondary metabolites occur, including flavonoids and phenolic compounds. Cyanogenic glycosides are present in some. Alkaloids and iridoids are generally absent. C4 photosynthesis has evolved independently in several lineages within Cyperaceae (e.g., some <i>Cyperus</i>, <i>Fimbristylis</i>, <i>Eleocharis</i>), particularly those adapted to warm, high-light, or saline environments.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
<h2>Identification Basics</h2>
<p>Identifying Cyperaceae involves recognizing the 'sedge' habit and carefully examining stems, leaves (especially sheaths), inflorescence structure, spikelets, floral scales, and achenes (plus perigynia in <i>Carex</i>).</p>
<div class="identification-feature"> <h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grass-like Herbaceous Habit:<i></i> Usually perennial, often tufted or rhizomatous.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stems (Culms) Often Triangular and Solid:<i></i> "Sedges have edges".</strong></li>
<li><strong>Leaves Usually 3-Ranked:<i></i> Arranged in three vertical rows along the stem/base.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Closed Leaf Sheaths:<i></i> Sheath encircles the culm without overlapping margins (usually).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Flowers Reduced in Spikelets:<i></i> Tiny flowers (florets) subtended by scale-like bracts, grouped into spikelets.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Perianth Absent or Bristle/Scale-like:<i></i> No showy petals or tepals.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ovary Superior, 1 Locule, 1 Basal Ovule.<i></i></strong></li>
<li><strong>Fruit an Achene:<i></i> Small, dry, single-seeded, often lens-shaped or triangular.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Habitat Often Moist/Wet:<i></i> Common in marshes, meadows, shores, wet woods.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Key Distinctions from Grasses &amp; Rushes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>vs. Poaceae (Grasses):<i></i> Grass stems usually round, hollow, with swollen nodes; leaves 2-ranked with open sheaths and ligules; florets enclosed by lemma/palea; fruit a grain (caryopsis).</strong></li>
<li><strong>vs. Juncaceae (Rushes):<i></i> Rush stems usually round and solid; leaves variable (round, flat, reduced); flowers small but regular with 6 distinct, scale-like tepals; fruit a capsule with multiple seeds.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: "Sedges have edges, Rushes are round, Grasses have nodes all the way to the ground" (or "have joints").</p>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Features for Genus/Species ID</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spikelet Structure &amp; Arrangement:<i></i> Solitary vs. clustered; arrangement in spikes, heads, panicles; number of flowers per spikelet.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Floral Scale Characteristics:<i></i> Shape, color, texture, tip (acute, awned).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Perianth Bristles/Scales:<i></i> Presence, absence, number, length, texture (barbed?).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Achene Characteristics:<i></i> Shape (lens-shaped vs. triangular), color, surface texture, presence of beak (persistent style base).</strong></li>
<li><strong><i>Carex</i> Specifics:<i></i> Presence and shape/texture/beak of the perigynium enclosing the achene; arrangement of male and female spikelets.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ligule/Sheath Details:<i></i> Presence/shape of ligule, nature of sheath front.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-tip">
<h3>Field Observation Tip</h3>
<p>A hand lens is essential for identifying sedges, especially for seeing details of florets, scales, achenes, and perigynia (<i>Carex</i>). Mature inflorescences and fruits are often required for accurate identification, making late summer and fall often the best time for study. Note the habitat carefully, as many species have specific moisture or soil preferences.</p>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Cyperaceae is a major family within the large monocot order Poales, belonging to the Commelinid clade. Poales is arguably the most ecologically and economically important plant order, dominated by the grasses (Poaceae) and sedges (Cyperaceae). Molecular phylogenetics places Cyperaceae as the sister family to Juncaceae (Rush family). Together, Cyperaceae and Juncaceae form a clade sister to another clade containing Typhaceae (Cattails) and Bromeliaceae (Bromeliads), among others, with Poaceae representing an earlier diverging lineage within the core Poales.</p>
<p>The family Cyperaceae itself is strongly monophyletic and traditionally divided into two major subfamilies, Cyperoideae and Mapanioideae (the latter mostly tropical), though recent phylogenies suggest a more complex structure with several major clades. The evolution within the family involved diversification into numerous wetland and temperate/boreal habitats, the refinement of wind pollination mechanisms (convergent with grasses and rushes), the unique development of the perigynium in the massive genus <i>Carex</i>, and multiple independent origins of the C4 photosynthetic pathway, particularly in genera adapted to warm, high-light conditions like <i>Cyperus</i> and <i>Fimbristylis</i>.</p>
<div class="phylogeny-position"> <h3>Position in Plant Phylogeny</h3>

</div>
<div class="related-families"> <h3>Related Families (Poales)</h3>
<p>Within the order Poales, Cyperaceae is closely related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Juncaceae</strong> (Rush family): Sister family. Mostly herbs of wet/cool areas, stems usually round/solid, flowers small/regular with 6 distinct tepals, fruit a capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Typhaceae</strong> (Cattail family): Robust wetland herbs, flowers unisexual/tiny/densely packed in cylindrical spikes.</li>
<li><strong>Bromeliaceae</strong> (Bromeliad family): Mostly tropical epiphytes/terrestrial herbs, often rosettes, flowers often showy with distinct sepals/petals.</li>
<li><strong>Poaceae</strong> (Grass family): Dominant family in order, stems usually round/hollow with nodes, leaves 2-ranked with open sheaths/ligules, flowers highly reduced (florets with lemma/palea) in spikelets, fruit a grain.</li>
<li>Eriocaulaceae, Xyridaceae, Rapateaceae, Mayacaceae, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance"> <h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Cyperaceae represents a major evolutionary success story among herbaceous monocots, particularly in colonizing and dominating wetland environments worldwide. Its diversification showcases adaptations to wind pollination (reduced flowers, feathery stigmas), various dispersal mechanisms (bristles, perigynia), and stressful conditions (C4 photosynthesis, tolerance of waterlogging). The evolution of the perigynium in <i>Carex</i>, creating a protective sac around the achene, is a remarkable innovation that likely contributed to the immense diversification of this genus, making it one of the largest angiosperm genera globally. Understanding Cyperaceae is crucial for wetland ecology, conservation, and studies of plant diversification in response to environmental gradients.</p>
