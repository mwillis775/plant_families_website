<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Didiereaceae family, in its modern circumscription (APG IV), includes 6 genera and about 16-20 species. The core group (subfamily Didiereoideae with 4 genera) is endemic to the unique spiny thickets of southern and southwestern Madagascar. The family was expanded to include <i>Portulacaria</i> and <i>Calyptrotheca</i> from mainland eastern and southern Africa, based on strong molecular evidence linking these previously separate families.</p>
<p>These plants are highly adapted to dry conditions, exhibiting succulence in stems and/or leaves, often possessing spines for defense and possibly reducing water loss, and frequently having small or seasonally deciduous leaves. Photosynthesis may occur primarily in the stems in some species. Flowers are generally small and unisexual (plants dioecious) in the Malagasy genera, while <i>Portulacaria</i> has bisexual flowers. Phylogenetically, Didiereaceae is nested within the Caryophyllales, an order renowned for its evolutionary diversification into arid environments and the repeated evolution of succulence.</p>
<p>Several species, particularly from the Malagasy genera and <i>Portulacaria afra</i>, are cultivated as curiosities by succulent collectors worldwide.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Plants are <strong>succulent shrubs or small trees</strong> adapted to arid conditions. Stems are often thick, woody or succulent, and frequently armed with formidable <strong>spines</strong>. Spines can be modified stipules or arise from short shoots (brachyblasts) that also bear the leaves. Some Malagasy species have distinctive columnar or octopus-like branching patterns. <i>Portulacaria</i> is typically a non-spiny succulent shrub or small tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually <strong>alternate</strong> (spirally arranged), but opposite in <i>Portulacaria</i>. They are <strong>simple</strong> with entire margins. Leaves are often small, fleshy/<strong>succulent</strong>, sometimes cylindrical or scale-like, and can be <strong>deciduous</strong> during the dry season or short-lived (ephemeral), especially in the spiny Malagasy genera where stems are the primary photosynthetic organs. In Didiereoideae, leaves are often clustered on short shoots (brachyblasts) located in the axils of spines. Stipules may be present (sometimes modified into spines) or absent.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Flowers are borne in axillary or terminal <strong>cymes</strong> or tight clusters (<strong>fascicles</strong>), sometimes appearing solitary.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are generally small, radially symmetrical (actinomorphic), and can be unisexual or bisexual. Plants are often <strong>dioecious</strong> (especially Didiereoideae) or sometimes monoecious; <i>Portulacaria</i> typically has bisexual flowers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perianth:</strong> Distinctive structure usually consisting of only <strong>2 outer, persistent, bract-like structures</strong> commonly interpreted as sepals, and <strong>(2-)4(-5) inner, often petaloid (petal-like) tepals</strong> which are typically free or slightly fused at the base. Tepals are often white, pink, yellowish, or greenish.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium (Male or Bisexual Flowers):</strong> Stamens usually number <strong>8-10</strong> (sometimes fewer or more), often arranged in two whorls. Filaments are free or slightly fused at the base. Anthers have two pollen sacs and open via longitudinal slits.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium (Female or Bisexual Flowers):</strong> Features a <strong>superior ovary</strong> composed of <strong>2-4 (usually 3) fused carpels</strong>, forming a single chamber (<strong>unilocular</strong>). A single ovule is attached at the base of the locule (<strong>basal placentation</strong>). A single style is present, usually topped by 2-4 stigmatic lobes or branches.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is typically a small, dry, indehiscent, one-seeded unit, either a <strong>nutlet</strong> or a <strong>samara</strong> (winged nutlet). The fruit may be enclosed or subtended by the persistent bract-like sepals or tepals. The seed contains a curved embryo and nutritive tissue called perisperm (derived from the nucellus, typical of Caryophyllales).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Many species likely utilize <strong>CAM photosynthesis</strong> (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) as an adaptation to conserve water in arid environments. The presence of <strong>betalain pigments</strong> (responsible for red/yellow colors, characteristic of many Caryophyllales) instead of anthocyanins is likely but needs confirmation across all genera. Mucilage cells may be present.</p>

<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Didiereaceae involves recognizing their succulent, often spiny nature within their specific geographic ranges (Madagascar and mainland Africa):</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Succulent shrub or tree habit:</strong> Plants adapted to dry conditions with fleshy stems and/or leaves.</li>
<li><strong>Spiny stems (common in Malagasy genera):</strong> Presence of sharp spines, often associated with clusters of small leaves on short shoots.</li>
<li><strong>Small, simple leaves:</strong> Often fleshy, sometimes ephemeral or deciduous, alternate or opposite (<i>Portulacaria</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Small flowers with distinctive perianth:</strong> Look for 2 outer bract-like sepals and 4-5 inner petaloid tepals.</li>
<li><strong>Superior, unilocular ovary:</strong> Ovary located above perianth attachment, with a single chamber and basal ovule.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic location:</strong> Found only in arid regions of Madagascar or Eastern/Southern Africa.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dioecious condition (common):</strong> Male and female flowers on separate plants.</li>
<li><strong>CAM photosynthesis indicators:</strong> Thick fleshy tissues.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit type:</strong> Small, dry nutlet or samara.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<p>Stem and spine characteristics are useful year-round:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year-round:</strong> Succulent habit, stem structure, presence/arrangement of spines are constant features.</li>
<li><strong>Growing/Rainy Season:</strong> Leaves are most likely to be present.</li>
<li><strong>Flowering/Fruiting Season (Varies):</strong> Small flowers or dry fruits may be observed, confirming identification.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<p>Distinguishing Didiereaceae from other succulent/spiny groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cactaceae (Cacti):</strong> Primarily New World (except <i>Rhipsalis</i>). Possess <strong>areoles</strong> (specialized pads from which spines, flowers, and branches arise). Flowers typically have numerous tepals and stamens, and an <strong>inferior ovary</strong>. Fruit is usually a berry.</li>
<li><strong>Euphorbiaceae (Succulent Euphorbias):</strong> Many African succulents resemble cacti but lack areoles, often produce <strong>milky latex</strong> when broken, and have highly specialized, reduced flowers arranged in <strong>cyathia</strong>. Fruit is typically a 3-parted capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Apocynaceae (Succulent Asclepiads/Stapeliads):</strong> Stem succulents often found in Africa, frequently lack spines or have softer emergences, often have milky latex, and possess complex 5-merous flowers often with a corona and specialized pollinia. Fruit typically paired follicles.</li>
<li><i>Focus on the combination:</i> Succulent Shrub/Tree (Madagascar/Africa) + Often Spiny + Small Leaves (often ephemeral/clustered) + Flowers with 2 Sepals &amp; 4-5 Tepals + Superior Unilocular Ovary = Didiereaceae.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Didiereaceae is firmly placed within the order <strong>Caryophyllales</strong>, a large and diverse order within the core eudicots. This order is particularly known for its high number of succulent plant families and adaptations to arid environments.</p>
<p>Within Caryophyllales, Didiereaceae belongs to the "succulent clade," which also includes families like Cactaceae (Cacti), Portulacaceae (Purslanes), Talinaceae, Anacampserotaceae, and Montiaceae. Molecular studies indicate a close relationship between Didiereaceae and these families, highlighting shared ancestry and likely convergent evolution of succulent traits. The inclusion of the African genera (<i>Portulacaria</i>, <i>Calyptrotheca</i>) with the Malagasy Didiereoideae into a single family reflects ancient biogeographic connections between Africa and Madagascar.</p>
