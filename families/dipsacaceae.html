<h1>Subfamily Dipsacoideae</h1>
<p class="guide-description"> Dipsacoideae, commonly known as the teasel group, represents a subfamily within the broadly defined Caprifoliaceae family (Order Dipsacales, Asterids). Formerly treated as the distinct family Dipsacaceae, this group comprises about 11 genera and 350 species, primarily herbs and shrubs native to the Old World. They are characterized by opposite leaves and, most distinctively, small flowers densely aggregated into terminal heads (capitula) surrounded by involucral bracts, superficially resembling the heads of Asteraceae. Individual flowers typically possess an epicalyx enclosing the inferior ovary, a pappus-like calyx, a 4- or 5-lobed corolla, and usually 4 stamens. The fruit is an achene enclosed within the persistent epicalyx.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Dipsacoideae subfamily has its greatest diversity in the Mediterranean region, extending through Europe, Africa, and Asia. Its placement within Caprifoliaceae sensu lato, alongside groups like Valerianoideae (valerians) and Linnaeoideae (twinflowers), is based on strong molecular phylogenetic evidence, despite the striking morphological difference of the flower head (capitulum). Key genera include <i>Dipsacus</i> (teasels), known for their prickly stems and dense, spiny flower heads; <i>Scabiosa</i> (pincushion flowers) and <i>Knautia</i> (field scabious), many species of which are popular garden ornamentals for their attractive, long-lasting flower heads; and <i>Cephalaria</i> (giant scabious).</p>
<p>The dense flower head (capitulum) functions as a single unit to attract pollinators, an example of convergent evolution with the Asteraceae family, though the underlying structure of the head and individual flowers differs significantly. The fruit, an achene tightly enclosed by the persistent epicalyx and often crowned by the pappus-like calyx, forms an effective dispersal unit, often distributed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>While primarily an Old World group, some species, notably Fuller's Teasel (<i>Dipsacus fullonum</i>), have become naturalized and potentially invasive weeds in North America, including Oklahoma (current location as of March 27, 2025), often found in pastures and disturbed areas. Ornamental <i>Scabiosa</i> are commonly cultivated.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group"> <h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Mostly biennial or perennial herbs, sometimes annuals or small shrubs. Stems and leaves often roughly hairy or prickly (<i>Dipsacus</i>).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are typically opposite (rarely whorled or basal), simple or often pinnately lobed to dissected. Stipules are absent (exstipulate). Bases of opposite leaves sometimes fused around the stem (<i>Dipsacus</i>).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence (Capitulum)</h3>
<p>The defining feature is the aggregation of numerous small flowers into a dense terminal head, called a <b>capitulum</b>, borne on a long stalk (peduncle). The base of the capitulum is surrounded by an <b>involucre</b> of herbaceous bracts. The surface of the receptacle (where flowers attach) often bears scale-like <b>receptacular bracts</b> (paleae) subtending each flower (<i>Dipsacus</i>) or may lack them (<i>Scabiosa</i>, <i>Knautia</i>). This structure superficially resembles the head of Asteraceae but evolved independently.</p>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram of Dipsacoideae capitulum (head)" src="../img/guides/dipsacoideae-capitulum.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Characteristic Dipsacoideae inflorescence: a dense head (capitulum) of many small flowers surrounded by involucral bracts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Individual flowers within the head are small, usually bisexual, and typically zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetric, especially the marginal flowers which may be larger and radiate) or sometimes actinomorphic (radially symmetric). Typically 4- or 5-merous perianth.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Epicalyx (Involucel):<i></i> A crucial diagnostic feature. Each individual flower's ovary is tightly enclosed by a cup-like or tubular structure called the epicalyx, formed from fused bracteoles. This structure persists and encloses the fruit.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Calyx:<b> Located on top of the ovary (within the epicalyx), typically small and cup-like, with the limb modified into </b>pappus-like bristles<i></i>, teeth, or awns (usually 5-10) which persist on the fruit and aid dispersal.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Corolla:<i></i> Composed of 4 or 5 fused petals (sympetalous), forming a tubular or funnel-shaped structure with spreading lobes. Lobes may be unequal, especially in marginal flowers, making the head appear radiate.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Androecium:<i></i> Stamens typically number 4 (rarely 2 or 3), attached to the corolla tube (epipetalous), alternate with the lobes. Anthers are distinct (not fused together as in Asteraceae).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:<b> Ovary is </b>inferior<i></i>, enclosed by the epicalyx. Composed of typically 2 fused carpels but functions as unilocular (single chamber) with a single pendulous ovule. A single slender style terminates in a simple or slightly 2-lobed stigma.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram of Dipsacoideae flower and fruit unit" src="../img/guides/dipsacoideae-flower-fruit.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Left: Single flower showing epicalyx around inferior ovary, pappus-like calyx, corolla, 4 stamens. Right: Fruit unit (achene enclosed in epicalyx, crowned by calyx).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is a dry, single-seeded, indehiscent fruit classified as an <b>achene</b>. A key characteristic is that this achene remains tightly enclosed within the persistent, often hardened <b>epicalyx</b>. The persistent, pappus-like calyx bristles or awns typically crown this entire fruit unit, which functions as the dispersal unit (diaspore).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Members typically contain iridoid glycosides (common in the order Dipsacales), as well as saponins and tannins. They generally lack the specific essential oils of Lamiaceae or alkaloids of other related orders.</p>

<h2>Identification Basics</h2>
<p>Identifying Dipsacoideae hinges on recognizing the combination of opposite leaves, flowers aggregated into Asteraceae-like heads, but with distinct individual flower structures (epicalyx, pappus-like calyx, 4 distinct stamens).</p>
<div class="identification-feature"> <h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit:<i></i> Mostly herbs, often with opposite leaves (simple or dissected).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inflorescence a Capitulum (Head):<i></i> Flowers densely clustered into a head surrounded by involucral bracts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Epicalyx Present:<i></i> Each individual flower ovary enclosed by a persistent cup-like structure (involucel).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Calyx Pappus-like:<i></i> Calyx modified into bristles or awns crowning the fruit unit.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Corolla Sympetalous:<i></i> Fused petals, 4- or 5-lobed, often zygomorphic (especially marginal flowers).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stamens Usually 4:<i></i> Distinct anthers (not fused into a tube).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ovary Inferior:<i></i> Located below floral parts, enclosed in epicalyx.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fruit an Achene:<i></i> Single-seeded, dry, enclosed within the persistent epicalyx.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Distinguishing from Asteraceae</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stamens:<i></i> Distinct in Dipsacoideae vs. Fused by anthers (syngenesious) in Asteraceae.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Epicalyx:<i></i> Present around individual ovary/fruit in Dipsacoideae vs. Absent in Asteraceae.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pappus:<i></i> Derived only from calyx in Asteraceae vs. Calyx pappus + surrounding epicalyx in Dipsacoideae fruit unit.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Receptacular Bracts:<i></i> Often spiny or chaffy in Asteraceae; variable in Dipsacoideae (present and spiny in <i>Dipsacus</i>, absent in <i>Scabiosa</i>).</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summer/Fall:<i></i> Peak flowering season. Flower heads are conspicuous.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fall/Winter:<i></i> Mature fruiting heads persist. Dried heads of <i>Dipsacus</i> are particularly noticeable and long-lasting. Basal rosettes of biennial/perennial species may be present.</strong></li>
<li><i>(Oklahoma Context: Naturalized </i>Dipsacus<i> flower heads visible summer/fall, dried stalks persist through winter in fields and roadsides).</i></li>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Subfamily Dipsacoideae represents a well-supported monophyletic lineage within the broadly defined Caprifoliaceae family (Order Dipsacales, Campanulids). Molecular data robustly place this group, along with other former families like Valerianaceae (Subfamily Valerianoideae) and Linnaeaceae (Subfamily Linnaeoideae), within Caprifoliaceae sensu lato. Dipsacoideae is often considered closely related to Valerianoideae and Morinaceae, sharing features like an achene fruit type and often modified calyx, though Dipsacoideae is unique in its capitulum inflorescence and prominent epicalyx.</p>
<p>The evolution of the dense flower head (capitulum) in Dipsacoideae is a remarkable example of convergent evolution with the Asteraceae family (Order Asterales). Both groups independently evolved a head-like structure functioning as a single pollination unit, likely driven by selection for enhanced pollinator attraction and efficient pollination. However, the underlying floral structures and developmental pathways differ significantly (e.g., epicalyx vs. none, distinct stamens vs. syngenesious anthers). The specialized fruit unit (achene enclosed in epicalyx, crowned by pappus-like calyx) is another key evolutionary feature related to dispersal.</p>

<p>Within the order Dipsacales, Dipsacoideae (as part of Caprifoliaceae s.l.) is related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other Caprifoliaceae Subfamilies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Valerianoideae (Valerians): Often herbs, zygomorphic flowers, pappus-like calyx, achene fruit.</li>
<li>Linnaeoideae (<i>Linnaea</i>, <i>Abelia</i>, <i>Weigela</i>, etc.): Often shrubs, variable flowers, capsule or achene fruits.</li>
<li>Caprifolioideae (<i>Lonicera</i>, <i>Symphoricarpos</i>): Often shrubs/vines, flowers often tubular/bilabiate, fruit usually a berry.</li>
<li>Morinaceae (sometimes included).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adoxaceae</strong> (Moschatel family): Sister family to Caprifoliaceae s.l. Includes <i>Sambucus</i>, <i>Viburnum</i>; opposite leaves, often actinomorphic flowers, fruit a drupe.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance"> <h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Dipsacoideae provides a compelling case study in convergent evolution (capitulum inflorescence similar to Asteraceae) and the evolution of specialized structures for reproduction and dispersal within the Dipsacales order. The development of the epicalyx enclosing the ovary and the modification of the calyx into a pappus-like structure create a unique dispersal unit (diaspore). Understanding this subfamily's phylogeny clarifies relationships within the expanded Caprifoliaceae and highlights the evolutionary pathways leading to complex inflorescences and fruit modifications within the Asterid clade.</p>
