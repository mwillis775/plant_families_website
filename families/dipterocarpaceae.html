<h1>Dipterocarpaceae</h1>
<p class="family-common-name">Dipterocarp Family / Meranti Family / Lauan Family</p>
<p class="family-description">Dipterocarpaceae is a large and ecologically dominant family of mostly tropical trees, renowned for forming the canopy and emergent layers of rainforests, particularly in Southeast Asia. They are characterized by their often large size, resin production, simple alternate leaves with stipules, and distinctive fruits – typically a nut surrounded by two or five persistent, enlarged, wing-like sepals. The family is a major source of tropical timber (Meranti, Lauan) and belongs to the order <strong>Malvales</strong>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Dipterocarpaceae family includes about 16-17 genera and nearly 700 species. Its center of diversity is Southeast Asia (especially Borneo, Sumatra, Malay Peninsula), where its species dominate vast areas of lowland and hill rainforest. Smaller groups occur in Africa, Madagascar, and a distinct subfamily (Pakaraimoideae) is found in the Guiana Shield region of South America.</p>
<p>These are typically large, resinous trees, often reaching great heights and forming the emergent canopy layer. Key characteristics include their simple, alternate leaves with stipules (often leaving scars), 5-parted flowers often with numerous stamens, and the highly diagnostic fruit – a nut subtended or surrounded by 2 or 5 enlarged, wing-like sepals that aid in wind dispersal (giving the family its name: di-ptero-carp = two-winged fruit). Phylogenetically, Dipterocarpaceae belongs to the Rosid order Malvales.</p>
<p>The family is of immense ecological and economic importance. Dipterocarp forests are hotspots of biodiversity, and the timber (known commercially by names like Meranti, Lauan, Keruing, Kapur) is globally significant, though heavy logging poses a major conservation threat to many species and ecosystems.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>The vast majority are medium to very large <strong>evergreen trees</strong>, often reaching heights of 40-70 meters or more. They typically have tall, straight, cylindrical trunks, often with buttresses at the base. Some smaller trees or shrubs exist. Plants characteristically produce <strong>resins</strong> (dammar), often visible as exudates on the trunk.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are arranged <strong>alternately</strong> (spirally). They are <strong>simple</strong>, usually with <strong>entire</strong> margins (sometimes wavy or slightly scalloped). Venation is pinnate. <strong>Stipules</strong> are present at the base of the petiole, often large and enclosing the bud, but typically fall off early (caducous), leaving prominent annular (ring-like) or linear <strong>scars</strong> on the twig. Leaves and twigs often possess characteristic multicellular hairs, such as stellate (star-shaped) or tufted hairs.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Flowers are borne in axillary or terminal, often relatively short and branched, <strong>panicles</strong>, <strong>racemes</strong>, or <strong>cymes</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are usually <strong>bisexual</strong>, <strong>radially symmetrical</strong> (actinomorphic) or sometimes slightly bilaterally symmetrical, typically <strong>5-merous</strong>, and often fragrant.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Consists of 5 sepals, usually fused at the base into a short tube, with strongly overlapping (imbricate) lobes. After flowering, the calyx is persistent and characteristically <strong>enlarges greatly</strong>, with either <strong>2 or all 5 lobes developing into prominent, leathery or woody wings</strong> attached to the base of the fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Consists of 5 free petals, often large and showy (white, yellow, pink, red), typically twisted or overlapping (contorted) in bud. Petals usually fall off quickly after the flower opens.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens are usually <strong>numerous</strong> (typically 15 to over 100, though sometimes as few as 5 or 10), arranged in whorls or appearing spiral. Filaments are usually short, free or fused at the very base. Anthers typically have 4 pollen sacs (though sometimes 2) and often possess a sterile, pointed or variously shaped appendage extending from the connective tissue at the apex. Anthers open by longitudinal slits.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> Features a <strong>superior</strong> ovary (usually; sometimes half-inferior), composed of <strong>3 fused carpels</strong> forming 3 locules (chambers), although sometimes reduced to 1 locule by abortion. A single style is present, which can be simple, lobed, or expanded at the base into a structure called a stylopodium. Ovules are typically 2 per locule, attached to axile placentas.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is typically a one-seeded (by abortion of other ovules) <strong>nut</strong>, which is indehiscent and pericarp (fruit wall) is woody or leathery. The most distinctive feature is that the fruit is almost always subtended or enclosed by the <strong>persistent, greatly enlarged, wing-like sepals</strong> (usually 2 long and 3 short, or 5 subequal wings), which facilitate wind dispersal (samara-like function). Seeds are relatively large, lack endosperm (or have very little), and have large, often folded cotyledons. Dipterocarp seeds are typically recalcitrant, meaning they cannot survive drying or low temperatures and germinate quickly upon falling.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>The family is characterized by the production of abundant oleoresins (dammar) in resin canals throughout the plant. Tannins and various terpenoids are also common.</p>

<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Dipterocarpaceae, especially in their native Asian rainforests, often relies on recognizing their stature, leaf scars, resin, and especially their unique fruits:</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large tree habit:</strong> Dominant canopy or emergent trees in tropical forests (mostly Asia).</li>
<li><strong>Alternate, simple leaves with stipule scars:</strong> Look for simple leaves arranged singly, and check twigs for prominent scars left by fallen stipules (often encircling the twig partly or fully).</li>
<li><strong>Resin production:</strong> Look for resin exudates on trunk wounds or cut surfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Winged nut fruit:</strong> The most diagnostic feature. Look for fallen fruits on the forest floor – a central nut surrounded by 2 or 5 large, persistent, wing-like sepals.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buttressed trunks:</strong> Common in large trees.</li>
<li><strong>Flowers (if seen):</strong> 5-parted, often fragrant, with numerous stamens (usually &gt;15).</li>
<li><strong>Contorted petals in bud:</strong> Petals often appear twisted before opening.</li>
<li><strong>Specific leaf venation patterns or hair types:</strong> Can be useful for genus/species ID with expertise.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<p>Fruits are the easiest diagnostic feature, often found seasonally:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year-round:</strong> Large tree habit, alternate leaves, and stipule scars are always present. Resin may be visible.</li>
<li><strong>Flowering Season (Varies, often supra-annual "mast" events):</strong> Flowers can be abundant but short-lived.</li>
<li><strong>Fruiting Season (Following flowering):</strong> The distinctive winged fruits litter the forest floor, making identification easy. Due to mast fruiting, fruits may be extremely abundant in some years and scarce in others.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<p>Distinguishing Dipterocarpaceae from other large tropical trees:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fabaceae (Legumes):</strong> Many large tropical trees, but typically have <strong>compound leaves</strong> and characteristic legume pods or other fruit types (not winged nuts).</li>
<li><strong>Lauraceae (Laurel family):</strong> Trees with simple alternate leaves, but leaves are often aromatic, lack stipules, flowers are small and typically 3-merous (6 tepals), and fruit is a drupe or berry, often with a cupule.</li>
<li><strong>Euphorbiaceae:</strong> Highly diverse, includes large trees, often have stipules, but frequently possess latex, have very different flower structures (often unisexual, reduced), and fruit is typically a 3-parted capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Combretaceae (e.g., <i>Terminalia</i>):</strong> Trees with simple alternate or opposite leaves, often lack stipules, flowers small, often apetalous, ovary inferior, fruit often winged but derived from ovary wall, not sepals.</li>
<li><i>Focus on the combination:</i> Large Resiniferous Tree (mostly Asia) + Alternate Simple Leaves + Prominent Stipule Scars + Winged Nut Fruit (2 or 5 sepal wings) = Dipterocarpaceae.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Dipterocarpaceae belongs to the order <strong>Malvales</strong>, within the Fabid (Malvid) clade of the Rosids (Eudicots). This placement is well-established through molecular phylogenetic studies.</p>
<p>Within Malvales, Dipterocarpaceae is part of a clade that often includes the Malagasy endemic family Sarcolaenaceae, and sometimes Cistaceae (Rockroses) and Bixaceae (Annatto family) are also found nearby phylogenetically. The order Malvales is large and diverse, containing well-known families like Malvaceae (Cotton, Hibiscus), Thymelaeaceae (Daphne), and the parasitic Cytinaceae.</p>
<p>The family itself is typically divided into three subfamilies: Dipterocarpoideae (containing almost all species, found in Asia, Africa, Madagascar), Monotoideae (Africa, Madagascar, Colombia), and Pakaraimoideae (one species in South America's Guiana Highlands), reflecting its ancient Gondwanan origins and subsequent diversification.</p>
