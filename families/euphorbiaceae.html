<h1>Euphorbiaceae</h1>
<p class="guide-description"> Euphorbiaceae, the spurge family, is a huge and extraordinarily diverse family of eudicots in the order Malpighiales (Rosid clade), containing about 220 genera and over 6,000 species. Cosmopolitan but most diverse in the tropics, the family includes herbs, shrubs, trees, vines, and remarkably convergent stem succulents resembling cacti. Key unifying features include strictly unisexual flowers (plants monoecious or dioecious) and a superior ovary typically composed of 3 carpels that matures into a schizocarpic capsule splitting into 3 single-seeded segments. Many members possess milky or colored latex, which is often caustic or poisonous. The giant genus <i>Euphorbia</i> is further characterized by its unique cyathium inflorescence.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Spurge family is one of the largest families of flowering plants, exhibiting tremendous morphological and ecological diversity. Its members range from tiny annual weeds to large rainforest trees, desert succulents, and aquatic herbs. This diversity is now understood within a more narrowly defined Euphorbiaceae (<i>sensu stricto</i>), as molecular phylogenetics led to the removal of several large groups (e.g., Phyllanthaceae, Picrodendraceae) into separate families. Still, the remaining core family is vast and widespread across the globe, particularly abundant in tropical regions.</p>
<p>Economically, Euphorbiaceae is highly significant. Natural rubber is derived from the latex of <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>. Cassava or manioc (<i>Manihot esculenta</i>) provides staple starchy roots for hundreds of millions in the tropics (requires processing to remove cyanogenic glycosides). Castor oil, used industrially and medicinally, comes from the seeds of <i>Ricinus communis</i> (the seeds themselves contain the deadly toxin ricin). Tung oil comes from <i>Vernicia</i> species. Countless species are grown as ornamentals, including the iconic Poinsettia (<i>Euphorbia pulcherrima</i>) with its colorful bracts, various succulent spurges mimicking cacti, crotons (<i>Codiaeum variegatum</i>) with colorful leaves, and <i>Acalypha</i> species (e.g., chenille plant). However, the family also includes numerous noxious weeds (<i>Euphorbia</i>, <i>Croton</i>) and highly poisonous plants.</p>
<p>The presence of milky latex (often white, sometimes clear or colored) is common but not universal; it frequently contains toxic compounds like diterpene esters. A unique feature of the largest genus, <i>Euphorbia</i> (spurges, &gt;2000 species), is the highly reduced and specialized inflorescence called a cyathium, which superficially resembles a single flower but contains multiple unisexual flowers within a cup-like structure. In Oklahoma (current location as of March 27, 2025), the family is well-represented by numerous native and weedy spurges (<i>Euphorbia</i> spp.), crotons or doveweeds (<i>Croton</i> spp.), three-seeded mercuries (<i>Acalypha</i> spp.), and the stinging noseburns (<i>Tragia</i> spp.).</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group"> <h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Extremely diverse: annual or perennial herbs, shrubs, trees, succulent stem/root forms (often strikingly convergent with cacti), and vines. A key feature in many (but not all) species is the presence of <strong>milky or colored latex</strong>, which is often caustic, irritant, or poisonous.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually alternate and spiral, but sometimes opposite or whorled. They are typically simple, although sometimes deeply lobed or palmately compound (e.g., <i>Manihot</i>, <i>Ricinus</i>). Leaf margins vary from entire to toothed. <strong>Stipules</strong> are usually present, but can be highly modified into glands, hairs, or spines, or sometimes absent or deciduous. Paired nectar glands (extrafloral nectaries) are sometimes found at the leaf base or on the petiole.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Inflorescence structure is highly variable. Flowers can be arranged in cymes, racemes, panicles, spikes, or head-like clusters. A highly specialized type found only in genus <i>Euphorbia</i> and close relatives is the <strong>cyathium</strong>:
                       <ul>
<li>A cup-shaped structure (involucre) formed from fused bracts.</li>
<li>Often bears prominent glands on its rim (marginal glands), which may have colorful petal-like appendages.</li>
<li>Inside the involucre are several highly reduced male flowers, each consisting of only a single stamen on a short stalk.</li>
<li>A single, central, typically stalked female flower, consisting only of a pistil (3-carpellate ovary), emerges from the center of the cyathium.</li>
</ul>
                       The entire cyathium functions biologically as a single flower. Structures appearing as petals in plants like Poinsettia are actually brightly colored leaves (bracts) located beneath the small cyathia.
                    </p>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram of Euphorbia cyathium structure" src="../img/guides/euphorbiaceae-cyathium.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Unique cyathium inflorescence of <i>Euphorbia</i>: Cup-like involucre with marginal glands enclosing reduced male flowers (single stamens) and a single central female flower (pistil).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are <strong>always unisexual</strong> (plants monoecious or dioecious). Flower structure varies greatly from relatively 'complete' (though usually apetalous) to extremely reduced.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perianth:</strong> Highly variable. Petals are almost always absent (apetalous). Sepals may be present (typically 3-6, small, often greenish) or absent entirely (aperianthous, as in the individual flowers within a cyathium).</li>
<li><strong>Androecium (Male Flowers):</strong> Stamens range from 1 (in cyathia) to numerous (&gt;100). Filaments can be free or fused (monadelphous).</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium (Female Flowers):</strong> Ovary is <strong>superior</strong>, typically composed of <strong>3 fused carpels</strong> forming <strong>3 locules</strong>. Placentation is axile, with typically 1 (sometimes 2) ovule per locule, usually pendulous. Styles are typically 3, often deeply bifid (forked) or branched.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The characteristic fruit is typically a <strong>schizocarpic capsule</strong> (often called a regma) derived from the 3-carpellate ovary. At maturity, it usually splits elastically or explosively into three single-seeded segments (mericarps or cocci), often leaving behind a persistent central column. Less commonly, the fruit is a drupe or berry. Seeds often possess a fleshy or oily appendage called a <strong>caruncle</strong> near the attachment point (hilum), which may attract ants for dispersal. Endosperm is usually present and oily.</p>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram of Euphorbiaceae schizocarpic capsule" src="../img/guides/euphorbiaceae-schizocarp.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Typical Euphorbiaceae fruit: a 3-lobed schizocarpic capsule splitting into segments, often leaving a central column. Seed often has a caruncle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>The family is known for diverse and often potent secondary metabolites. <strong>Latex</strong> contains various compounds, including complex diterpene esters (e.g., phorbol esters in <i>Euphorbia</i> and related genera, known skin/eye irritants and tumor promoters), triterpenes (source of rubber in <i>Hevea</i>), and sometimes alkaloids. Cyanogenic glycosides are common (e.g., in <i>Manihot</i>). Extremely toxic proteins like ricin occur in <i>Ricinus</i> seeds. Glucosinolates (mustard oils) and iridoids are absent.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Identification Basics</h2>
<p>Identifying Euphorbiaceae often relies on checking for milky latex, unisexual flowers, the characteristic 3-parted schizocarpic fruit, or the unique cyathium structure of <i>Euphorbia</i>.</p>
<div class="identification-feature"> <h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Milky or Colored Latex (Often Present):</strong> Check broken stems or leaves (use caution, often irritant).</li>
<li><strong>Unisexual Flowers:</strong> Flowers strictly male or female (plants monoecious or dioecious).</li>
<li><strong>Superior Ovary, Typically 3-Carpellate:</strong> Ovary positioned above other floral parts, usually with 3 locules and 3 (often bifid) styles.</li>
<li><strong>Schizocarpic Capsule (Typically):</strong> Fruit usually a 3-lobed capsule splitting into 1-seeded segments.</li>
<li><strong>OR Cyathium Inflorescence:</strong> Cup-like structure containing reduced unisexual flowers (diagnostic for <i>Euphorbia</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Leaves Usually Alternate and Simple:</strong> Often with stipules (may be small/modified).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presence/Type of Stipules:</strong> Glandular, spiny, or typical.</li>
<li><strong>Leaf Shape/Compoundness:</strong> Simple vs. palmately compound (<i>Manihot</i>, <i>Ricinus</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Flower Details (Non-Cyathium):</strong> Presence/absence of sepals, number/fusion of stamens.</li>
<li><strong>Cyathium Details:</strong> Shape of involucre, number/shape of glands and appendages.</li>
<li><strong>Succulent Habit:</strong> Cactus-like forms (check for latex/cyathia).</li>
<li><strong>Seed Caruncle:</strong> Presence of appendage on seed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growing Season (Warm Months):</strong> Latex is present. Flowers and fruits develop, crucial for ID. Many are weedy annuals prominent in summer/fall.</li>
<li><strong>Year-round:</strong> Woody or succulent forms retain structure. Persistent dried capsules might be found.</li>
<li><i>(Oklahoma Context: Many native and weedy <i>Euphorbia</i> (spurges), <i>Croton</i> (doveweeds), and <i>Acalypha</i> (copperleafs) flower and fruit throughout the summer and fall. Look for latex and fruit characteristics).</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cactaceae (Cactus Family):</strong> Succulent stem convergence. Key differences: Cacti lack milky latex (usually watery sap); have areoles (specialized spine-bearing buds); flowers bisexual with inferior ovary; fruit a berry.</li>
<li><strong>Apocynaceae (Dogbane Family):</strong> Often have milky latex. Key differences: Leaves usually opposite; flowers usually bisexual, 5-merous with distinct corolla/stamens (or column/pollinia); fruit typically paired follicles or drupes.</li>
<li><strong>Moraceae (Fig Family):</strong> Woody plants often with milky latex, alternate simple leaves. Key differences: Stipule scar usually encircles twig; flowers tiny, unisexual, aggregated into complex structures (syconia, heads, catkins); fruit a multiple.</li>
<li><strong>Malvaceae (Mallow Family):</strong> Herbs/shrubs often with alternate simple leaves (often palmately lobed) and stellate hairs, superior ovary, capsule/schizocarp fruit. Key differences: Usually mucilaginous sap (not milky latex); flowers bisexual with 5 distinct petals and stamens fused into a column.</li>
<li><strong>Phyllanthaceae:</strong> Formerly included in Euphorbiaceae. Similarities exist, but often lack latex, typically have 2 ovules per locule (vs. 1), and different fruit dehiscence/seed details (molecular data separates them).</li>
</ul>
<p>Look for: Milky Latex + Unisexual Flowers + Superior 3-Carpellate Ovary + Schizocarpic Capsule. If these fit, it's likely Euphorbiaceae. If flowers are in cyathia, it's <i>Euphorbia</i>.</p>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Euphorbiaceae belongs to the enormous and diverse order Malpighiales, situated within the Fabid (Eurosid I) clade of Rosids (Core Eudicots). Molecular phylogenetics has led to a significant refinement of the family's boundaries. The traditional, very broad concept of Euphorbiaceae was found to be polyphyletic. Several distinct lineages, such as Phyllanthaceae, Picrodendraceae, Putranjivaceae, Pandaceae, and Peraceae, have been removed and recognized as separate families, sometimes placed in different orders. Euphorbiaceae <i>sensu stricto</i> (in the strict sense), as defined by APG, represents a large, well-supported monophyletic group, although internal relationships are still being resolved.</p>
<p>Within Malpighiales, Euphorbiaceae s.s. is part of a large clade, but its precise sister group is not always consistently resolved; potential relatives include families like Rafflesiaceae (giant parasitic flowers, surprisingly nested within Euphorbiaceae s.l. by some analyses, though relationship complex) and others within the vast Malpighiales radiation (which also includes Salicaceae, Violaceae, Passifloraceae, Rhizophoraceae, Linaceae, Erythroxylaceae, etc.). The family showcases immense evolutionary diversification in morphology (especially habit, including convergence with cacti), biochemistry (latex, diterpenes, ricin), and reproductive strategies (unisexual flowers, specialized cyathium).</p>

<p>Within the vast order Malpighiales, Euphorbiaceae is related to a diverse array of families, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phyllanthaceae:</strong> Formerly part of Euphorbiaceae s.l. Differ in having 2 ovules per locule (vs. 1), often lack latex, fruit types vary.</li>
<li><strong>Salicaceae</strong> (Willow/Poplar family): Woody plants, simple alternate leaves, flowers reduced in catkins, superior ovary, capsule fruit with cottony seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Violaceae</strong> (Violet family): Often herbs, zygomorphic flowers (typically), superior ovary, capsule fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Passifloraceae</strong> (Passion Flower family): Often vines with tendrils, complex flowers with corona, superior ovary, fruit a berry or capsule.</li>
<li>Rhizophoraceae (Mangrove family), Erythroxylaceae (Coca family), Linaceae (Flax family), Rafflesiaceae (parasitic), and many others.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance"> <h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Euphorbiaceae is a prime example of explosive evolutionary radiation, resulting in tremendous diversity in form, function, and ecological niche occupation, particularly in tropical regions. Key evolutionary themes include the development of diverse latex systems containing potent chemical defenses, remarkable convergence with cacti in succulent lineages adapting to arid environments, and the highly specialized cyathium inflorescence in <i>Euphorbia</i> – a unique evolutionary solution for packaging tiny unisexual flowers into functional pollination units. The family's economic impact highlights the evolutionary success of its chemical and structural innovations exploited by humans.</p>
