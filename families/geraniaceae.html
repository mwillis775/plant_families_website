<h1>Geraniaceae</h1>
<p class="guide-description"> Geraniaceae, the geranium family, belongs to the order <i>Geraniales</i> within the Rosid clade of eudicots. Comprising about 5-7 genera and over 800 species, it consists mostly of herbs or subshrubs, often bearing glandular hairs making them aromatic. Key characteristics include typically alternate or opposite, palmately lobed or compound leaves with stipules; flowers usually 5-merous and radially symmetric (though sometimes bilaterally symmetric); typically 10 stamens; a superior, 5-lobed ovary; and a distinctive schizocarpic fruit that splits into 5 single-seeded segments, often attached to coiling awns derived from the persistent style ('crane's-bill').</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Geranium family has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution but is most diverse in temperate and subtropical regions, with a major center of diversity for the genus <i>Pelargonium</i> in South Africa. The three main genera are <i>Geranium</i> (true cranesbills, typically with radially symmetric flowers), <i>Erodium</i> (storksbills or filarees, often with pinnately compound leaves and sensitive fruit awns), and <i>Pelargonium</i> (includes most common horticultural 'geraniums', with bilaterally symmetric flowers often bearing a nectar spur).</p>
<p>Economically, the family is most significant for ornamental horticulture. <i>Pelargonium</i> species and hybrids are globally popular bedding plants, container plants, and houseplants, commonly but incorrectly referred to as 'geraniums'. Many true <i>Geranium</i> species (hardy cranesbills) are also valued garden perennials. Some <i>Pelargonium</i> species are cultivated for 'geranium oil', an essential oil used in perfumery and aromatherapy. While not major food sources, some species have had traditional medicinal uses. Several species, particularly <i>Erodium cicutarium</i> (Common Storksbill), are widespread weeds of disturbed ground, lawns, and agricultural areas.</p>
<p>The family's most distinctive feature is arguably its unique fruit dispersal mechanism. The schizocarpic fruit, often resembling a bird's beak before splitting (hence common names like 'cranesbill' and 'storksbill'), forcefully ejects the single-seeded segments (mericarps). These segments often remain attached to awns (derived from the styles) that coil or twist hygroscopically (in response to humidity changes), aiding in seed burial or further dispersal.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma (current location as of March 27, 2025), the native Carolina Cranesbill (<i>Geranium carolinianum</i>) is common, and the weedy Common Storksbill (<i>Erodium cicutarium</i>) is often abundant, especially in spring. Cultivated <i>Pelargonium</i> are common garden and container plants during warm months.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group"> <h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Mostly annual or perennial herbs or subshrubs, rarely shrubs (<i>Pelargonium</i>). Stems often jointed at the nodes, sometimes succulent (<i>Pelargonium</i>, <i>Sarcocaulon</i>). Plants frequently covered in simple and/or glandular hairs, often making them aromatic when bruised.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually alternate or opposite, simple but typically palmately lobed, divided, or dissected (<i>Geranium</i>, <i>Pelargonium</i>), sometimes pinnately compound (<i>Erodium</i>). Stipules are usually present and paired at the base of the petiole.</p>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Palmately lobed Geranium leaf and Pinnately compound Erodium leaf" src="../img/guides/geraniaceae-leaves.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Leaf diversity: Palmately lobed leaf (<i>Geranium</i>, left) and pinnately compound leaf (<i>Erodium</i>, right), both typically with stipules.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Inflorescences are typically cymose, often appearing as umbel-like clusters (pseudo-umbels) borne on axillary or terminal peduncles. Flowers sometimes solitary.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are usually bisexual, typically 5-merous (sometimes 4-merous), and hypogynous (superior ovary). Symmetry varies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actinomorphic (Radially Symmetric):</strong> Typical for <i>Geranium</i> and <i>Erodium</i>.</li>
<li><strong>Zygomorphic (Bilaterally Symmetric):</strong> Characteristic of <i>Pelargonium</i>, where flowers often have unequal petals and a nectar spur fused to the pedicel (flower stalk).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other floral features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Usually 5 distinct or slightly fused sepals, often persistent. In <i>Pelargonium</i>, the posterior sepal is typically associated with a nectar spur fused along the pedicel.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Usually 5 distinct (free) petals, often conspicuous and colored (pink, purple, red, white), frequently with nectar guide lines. Petals often quickly deciduous. Unequal petals common in <i>Pelargonium</i>.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens typically 10, arranged in two whorls of 5 (sometimes fewer fertile, e.g., 5 fertile + 5 staminodes, or 2-7 fertile in <i>Pelargonium</i>). Filaments are often fused slightly at the base into a ring, and may be dilated. Nectar glands often present, alternating with the petals.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> Ovary is superior, composed of typically 5 fused carpels forming 5 distinct lobes around a central column (elongated receptacle/style tissue). Each locule contains 1 or 2 ovules with axile placentation. Styles are fused together into the elongated column, separating at the apex into 5 receptive stigmas.</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is highly characteristic: a <strong>schizocarp</strong> often called a 'crane's-bill' or 'storksbill'. It consists of usually 5 single-seeded segments (mericarps) arranged around a persistent central column (derived from the elongated style). At maturity, the segments typically separate elastically from the base upwards, often remaining attached at the apex to awns (derived from the styles). These awns are frequently hygroscopic, coiling and uncoiling with changes in humidity, which can propel the seed or help drill it into the soil. Seeds usually lack endosperm or have very little; the embryo is often bent or folded.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Often contain essential oils (terpenoids like geraniol, citronellol) located in glandular hairs, contributing to characteristic scents (esp. <i>Pelargonium</i>). Tannins, phenolic acids, and flavonoids are also common. Significant alkaloids are generally rare.</p>

<h2>Identification Basics</h2>
<p>Identifying Geraniaceae often involves recognizing the lobed/dissected leaves (often aromatic), 5-parted flowers, and especially the unique 'crane's-bill' schizocarpic fruit.</p>
<div class="identification-feature"> <h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Mostly herbs or subshrubs, often with glandular hairs (aromatic).</li>
<li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Alternate or opposite, usually palmately lobed/dissected or pinnately compound (<i>Erodium</i>), with stipules.</li>
<li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Usually 5-merous (5 sepals, 5 distinct petals), actinomorphic (<i>Geranium</i>, <i>Erodium</i>) or zygomorphic (<i>Pelargonium</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Stamens:</strong> Usually 10 (sometimes fewer fertile), often basally connate.</li>
<li><strong>Ovary Superior, 5-lobed:</strong> With styles fused into a central column.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit a Schizocarp ('Crane's-bill'):</strong> Splitting into 5 single-seeded segments attached to awns that separate elastically from a central column.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flower Symmetry:</strong> Radial vs. Bilateral helps separate major genera.</li>
<li><strong>Nectar Spur:</strong> Presence fused to pedicel (<i>Pelargonium</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Leaf Dissection:</strong> Palmate vs. Pinnate.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit Awn Behavior:</strong> Hygroscopic coiling/twisting.</li>
<li><strong>Aroma:</strong> Presence and type of scent when crushed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spring/Summer:</strong> Peak flowering season for most temperate species.</li>
<li><strong>Summer/Fall:</strong> Characteristic 'crane's-bill' fruits develop and are highly diagnostic, even after seeds have dispersed (persistent column/awns).</li>
<li><strong>Year-round:</strong> Basal rosettes of perennials may persist. Aromatic foliage present during growing season.</li>
<li>(Oklahoma Context: Weedy <i>Erodium cicutarium</i> flowers very early spring (even late winter) and sporadically later. Native <i>Geranium carolinianum</i> flowers spring/summer. Cultivated <i>Pelargonium</i> bloom through warm months).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Malvaceae (Mallow Family):</strong> Often herbs with alternate, palmately lobed leaves and stipules, 5 distinct petals. Key differences: Flowers have stamens fused into a prominent column around the style; fruit typically a ring of schizocarps (mericarps) or a capsule; lack 'crane's-bill' fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Ranunculaceae (Buttercup Family):</strong> Often herbs with dissected leaves, 5 petals/sepals, superior ovary. Key differences: Usually lack stipules; flowers typically have numerous simple pistils (apocarpous); fruit usually achenes or follicles; lack 'crane's-bill' fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Oxalidaceae (Wood Sorrel Family):</strong> Herbs with palmately compound leaves (usually 3 leaflets resembling clover). Key differences: Fruit typically an explosively dehiscent capsule; leaves often show 'sleep movements'; stipules usually absent.</li>
<li><strong>Some Rosaceae (Rose Family):</strong> Some herbs (<i>Potentilla</i>, <i>Geum</i>) have lobed/compound leaves, stipules, 5 petals, superior ovary. Key differences: Stamens usually numerous (&gt;10); gynoecium structure differs (often numerous distinct pistils); fruit achenes or drupelets, lack 'crane's-bill' mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>The distinctive 5-parted schizocarp fruit splitting from a central column ('crane's-bill') is the most unique and reliable feature for identifying Geraniaceae.</p>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Geraniaceae is the core family of the relatively small order <i>Geraniales</i>, located within the Rosid clade of Eudicots. Its exact position relative to other major Rosid orders (like <i>Myrtales</i>, <i>Malvales</i>, <i>Fabales</i>, <i>Rosales</i>) has varied slightly in different analyses, but it is consistently placed within the Rosids, often associated with or sister to <i>Myrtales</i> within the Malvid subgroup, or sometimes considered an earlier diverging Rosid lineage.</p>
<p>Within <i>Geraniales</i>, Geraniaceae is closely related to Melianthaceae and Francoaceae (which now includes Vivianiaceae and Ledocarpaceae under APG IV). The family Geraniaceae itself is well-supported, with clear distinctions between the major genera based on floral symmetry (<i>Geranium</i>/<i>Erodium</i> vs. <i>Pelargonium</i>), stamen number, and leaf type (<i>Erodium</i>). The evolution of the characteristic schizocarpic fruit with its elastic and/or hygroscopic awn mechanism for seed dispersal is a key innovation defining the family.</p>

</div>
<div class="related-families"> <h3>Related Families (<i>Geraniales</i>)</h3>
<p>Within the order <i>Geraniales</i>, Geraniaceae is related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Melianthaceae:</strong> Small family of shrubs/trees primarily from southern Africa, often with large pinnate leaves and zygomorphic flowers.</li>
<li><strong>Francoaceae:</strong> Expanded family (including former Vivianiaceae, Ledocarpaceae) of herbs or shrubs mainly from South America, variable flowers, often capsular fruit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The order <i>Geraniales</i> itself is part of the Rosid clade, related to other major orders like <i>Myrtales</i>, <i>Malvales</i>, <i>Brassicales</i>, <i>Fabales</i>, <i>Rosales</i>, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance"> <h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Geraniaceae provides an excellent example of the evolution of specialized seed dispersal mechanisms, particularly the hygroscopic movement of awns in <i>Erodium</i> for self-burial and the explosive dehiscence in <i>Geranium</i>. The divergence in floral symmetry between <i>Geranium</i>/<i>Erodium</i> (actinomorphic) and <i>Pelargonium</i> (zygomorphic, spurred) illustrates evolutionary shifts potentially related to pollinator specialization. The family's production of aromatic essential oils (<i>Pelargonium</i>) highlights chemical diversification within the Rosids. Its relatively isolated position within the Rosids makes it important for understanding broader relationships within this major eudicot clade.</p>
