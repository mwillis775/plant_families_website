<h1>Lamiaceae (Labiatae)</h1>
<p class="guide-description"> Lamiaceae, commonly known as the mint or deadnettle family (alternatively Labiatae), is a large and cosmopolitan family of eudicots in the order Lamiales, comprising about 236 genera and over 7,200 species. Primarily herbs or shrubs, they are renowned for producing aromatic essential oils. Key identifying features typically include square stems, opposite leaves, zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetric) and often two-lipped (bilabiate) flowers, a superior ovary that becomes deeply 4-lobed, a style arising from the base between the lobes (gynobasic), and fruit typically splitting into four single-seeded nutlets.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Mint family is distributed worldwide, thriving in diverse habitats but particularly abundant in Mediterranean climates. It holds immense economic and cultural value, primarily due to the volatile terpenoid compounds (essential oils) produced in glandular hairs found on the leaves and stems of many species. This accounts for the widespread use of Lamiaceae members as culinary herbs (mint, basil, oregano, thyme, sage, rosemary, marjoram, savory), medicinal plants (lavender, peppermint, thyme), and sources of fragrances (lavender, patchouli). Numerous genera, including <i>Salvia</i>, <i>Monarda</i>, <i>Stachys</i>, <i>Agastache</i>, and the popular foliage plant <i>Coleus</i> (<i>Plectranthus</i>/<i>Coleus</i> complex), are staples in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>The combination of square stems (easily felt by rolling between fingers), opposite leaves (typically decussate, forming pairs at right angles to the pairs above and below), and bilabiate flowers arranged in apparent whorls (verticillasters) makes the family relatively easy to recognize, although exceptions to each feature exist. The characteristic aroma released when leaves are crushed is another strong indicator for many common genera. The unique gynobasic style, appearing to arise from the base of the deeply four-lobed ovary, leading to a fruit of four nutlets, is also highly diagnostic.</p>
<p>Many species are important components of native ecosystems, providing nectar and pollen for pollinators (especially bees and hummingbirds). Oklahoma (current location as of March 27, 2025) has numerous native Lamiaceae, such as Bee Balm/Wild Bergamot (<i>Monarda fistulosa</i>), Azure Blue Sage (<i>Salvia azurea</i>), various Skullcaps (<i>Scutellaria</i> spp.), and Obedient Plant (<i>Physostegia</i> spp.). Common weeds also belong here, like Henbit (<i>Lamium amplexicaule</i>) and Purple Deadnettle (<i>Lamium purpureum</i>), which are often abundant in lawns and disturbed areas during late winter and spring (relevant for current date).</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group"> <h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Mostly annual or perennial herbs or shrubs; less commonly trees or lianas. Stems are characteristically square in cross-section in most species (though some have rounded stems). Plants are often aromatic due to essential oils produced in glandular hairs covering leaves and stems.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are almost always arranged oppositely, and typically decussate (each pair oriented 90 degrees to the pair below). Rarely whorled or alternate. Leaves are usually simple, though sometimes pinnately lobed or dissected. Margins are commonly toothed (serrate or crenate), sometimes entire. Stipules are absent.</p>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram showing square stem and opposite decussate leaves" src="../img/guides/lamiaceae-stem-leaves.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Characteristic square stem and opposite, decussate leaves of many Lamiaceae.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Inflorescence structure appears complex. The basic unit is typically a pair of contracted cymes located in the axils of opposite leaves or bracts. These axillary clusters often encircle the stem, forming an apparent whorl called a verticillaster. Verticillasters can be spaced apart along the stem or aggregated terminally into spike-like, raceme-like, or head-like structures. Less commonly, flowers are solitary in leaf axils.</p>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram of verticillaster inflorescence" src="../img/guides/lamiaceae-verticillaster.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Verticillaster: Dense flower clusters in the axils of opposite leaves, appearing as whorls around the square stem.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are usually bisexual and strongly zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetric), adapted for insect or bird pollination. Sometimes nearly actinomorphic (e.g., <i>Mentha</i>). Typically 5-merous perianth.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Composed of 5 fused sepals (synsepalous), forming a persistent tube or bell shape. The calyx can be actinomorphic (with 5 equal lobes) or zygomorphic (2-lipped, often 2 lobes up / 3 lobes down, or other combinations). Often ribbed and sometimes hairy or colored.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Composed of 5 fused petals (sympetalous), characteristically forming a 2-lipped (bilabiate) structure. The upper lip typically consists of 2 fused petal lobes and may be flat or arching (galeate); the lower lip typically consists of 3 fused petal lobes, with the central lobe often larger and serving as a landing platform. Corolla tube length varies greatly.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens typically number 4 and are didynamous (arranged as 2 long pairs + 2 short pairs), or sometimes reduced to only 2 fertile stamens (e.g., <i>Salvia</i>, <i>Monarda</i>). Stamens are attached to the corolla tube (epipetalous), alternating with the lower corolla lobes. Anthers typically open via longitudinal slits.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> Ovary is superior, composed of 2 fused carpels. A key feature is that the ovary becomes deeply 4-lobed early in development due to intrusion of the ovary walls or formation of false septa. A single style arises from the deep depression between the four lobes (gynobasic style). Each lobe contains a single ovule attached near the base (basal placentation). The style usually ends in two small stigma lobes. A nectar disc is typically present around the base of the ovary lobes.</li>
</ul>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram of Lamiaceae bilabiate flower and 4-lobed ovary with gynobasic style" src="../img/guides/lamiaceae-flower-ovary.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Left: Typical Lamiaceae bilabiate flower. Right: Superior ovary deeply 4-lobed with gynobasic style arising from the center.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The characteristic fruit is a schizocarp that develops from the 4-lobed ovary. At maturity, it splits into 4 distinct, single-seeded, dry segments called nutlets (or sometimes small drupelets if slightly fleshy). These nutlets are often smooth or slightly textured and are dispersed individually. Seeds contain little or no endosperm; the embryo is typically straight.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>The family is defined chemically by the widespread production of volatile terpenoid compounds (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes) that constitute essential oils. These oils are typically stored in glandular hairs on the plant surface and are responsible for the characteristic aromas of mint, sage, basil, lavender, etc. These compounds likely function in deterring herbivores and attracting specific pollinators. Iridoids, phenolic acids (like rosmarinic acid), flavonoids, and sometimes diterpenoids or alkaloids are also present.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Identification Basics</h2>
<p>The Mint family is often readily identified by a combination of vegetative and floral features, frequently confirmed by aroma.</p>
<div class="identification-feature"> <h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Square Stems:</strong> Feel the stem; it usually has four distinct corners (most reliable on younger stems).</li>
<li><strong>Opposite Leaves:</strong> Leaves arranged in pairs directly across from each other at nodes (typically decussate).</li>
<li><strong>Zygomorphic / Bilabiate Flowers:</strong> Flowers usually distinctly two-lipped (though sometimes nearly regular in <i>Mentha</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Superior Ovary, Deeply 4-Lobed:</strong> Ovary divided into four distinct segments.</li>
<li><strong>Gynobasic Style:</strong> Style appears to arise from the base, deep between the ovary lobes.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit 4 Nutlets:</strong> Mature fruit splits into four small, dry, single-seeded units.</li>
<li><strong>Aromatic Foliage (Often):</strong> Crushed leaves or stems frequently release a characteristic minty, savory, or pungent aroma.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verticillaster Inflorescence:</strong> Flowers clustered in apparent whorls at nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Stamen Number:</strong> Typically 4 (didynamous) or sometimes 2.</li>
<li><strong>Calyx Shape:</strong> Actinomorphic (5 equal teeth) vs. Zygomorphic (2-lipped).</li>
<li><strong>Hair Type:</strong> Presence of simple, branched, or glandular hairs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growing Season (Spring-Fall):</strong> Square stems, opposite leaves, and aroma are usually detectable. Flowering peaks typically summer to fall for many natives, but spring for weeds like <i>Lamium</i>.</li>
<li><strong>Winter: Dried stems may still show square shape and opposite branching. Persistent calyces or nutlets might be present. Basal rosettes of some species may overwinter.</strong></li>
<li><i>(Current Time Context: Late March in Oklahoma - Weedy species like Henbit (<i>Lamium amplexicaule</i>) and Purple Deadnettle (<i>Lamium purpureum</i>) are likely flowering profusely in lawns and disturbed areas. Native perennials are starting vegetative growth).</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verbenaceae (Vervain Family):</strong> Often has square stems and opposite leaves. Key differences: Ovary is typically NOT deeply 4-lobed; style is terminal (attached at the apex of the ovary); fruit usually a drupe or schizocarp splitting into 2 or 4 pyrenes (stony units), not dry nutlets. Often less aromatic.</li>
<li><strong>Scrophulariaceae / Plantaginaceae / Orobanchaceae (related Lamiales):</strong> May have opposite leaves and zygomorphic flowers. Key differences: Stems usually round; ovary superior but typically NOT 4-lobed; style terminal; fruit usually a capsule with multiple seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Acanthaceae (Acanthus Family):</strong> Opposite leaves, zygomorphic flowers, superior ovary. Key differences: Stems usually round; fruit a capsule, often with explosive dehiscence via hook-like retinacula; ovary structure differs.</li>
<li><strong>Urticaceae (<i>Urtica</i> - Nettles):</strong> Sometimes have square stems and opposite leaves. Key differences: Flowers tiny, unisexual, greenish, lack showy corolla; often have stinging hairs; fruit an achene.</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of Square Stem + Opposite Leaves + Bilabiate Flower + Deeply 4-Lobed Superior Ovary + Gynobasic Style + 4 Nutlets is the most reliable set of characters for Lamiaceae.</p>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Lamiaceae is a major family within the core of the large order Lamiales, belonging to the Lamiid clade of Asterids. It is closely related to other prominent Lamiales families like Verbenaceae, Acanthaceae, Bignoniaceae, Orobanchaceae, Plantaginaceae, and Oleaceae. The traditional circumscription based on the gynobasic style and 4 nutlets holds up well under molecular phylogenetic analyses, although some genera previously placed in Verbenaceae (e.g., <i>Callicarpa</i>, <i>Tectona</i>, <i>Clerodendrum</i> - though latter's placement debated) have sometimes been included in a broader Lamiaceae by some classifications, reflecting complex relationships at the base of these families.</p>
<p>The family is typically divided into several subfamilies (e.g., Nepetoideae, Lamioideae, Ajugoideae, Scutellarioideae), which often differ in chemical profiles (Nepetoideae being particularly rich in volatile terpenoids), pollen structure, and embryology. The evolution of the characteristic bilabiate flower is strongly linked to pollination by bees and other insects, while the reduction to two stamens in genera like <i>Salvia</i> and <i>Monarda</i> represents further specialization. The production of diverse essential oils is a key evolutionary feature, likely providing defense against herbivores and pathogens while also playing roles in attracting pollinators or deterring competitors.</p>

<div class="related-families"> <h3>Related Families</h3>
<p>Within the order Lamiales, Lamiaceae is closely related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verbenaceae</strong> (Vervain family): Often square stems/opposite leaves, but ovary usually not 4-lobed, style terminal, fruit often drupes/schizocarps.</li>
<li><strong>Oleaceae</strong> (Olive family): Opposite leaves, superior ovary, but flowers often actinomorphic, 4-merous, with only 2 stamens. Mostly woody.</li>
<li><strong>Plantaginaceae</strong> (Plantain family): Highly diverse, often zygomorphic flowers, superior ovary, but fruit a capsule, stems usually round.</li>
<li><strong>Orobanchaceae</strong> (Broomrape family): Parasitic herbs, zygomorphic flowers, superior ovary, fruit a capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Acanthaceae</strong> (Acanthus family): Opposite leaves, zygomorphic flowers, superior ovary, capsule fruit often with explosive dehiscence.</li>
<li>Many other families including Bignoniaceae, Gesneriaceae, Scrophulariaceae s.s., Phrymaceae.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance"> <h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Lamiaceae exemplifies a highly successful evolutionary radiation characterized by a suite of distinctive morphological features (square stems, opposite leaves, bilabiate flowers, 4 nutlets) and a remarkable diversification of chemical defenses/attractants (essential oils). Its success across diverse habitats worldwide is linked to these traits. The family showcases varied pollination syndromes, from generalist bee pollination to specialized mechanisms involving levers (<i>Salvia</i>) or specific adaptations for bird or moth pollination in some groups. Its immense utility to humans for culinary, medicinal, and aromatic purposes highlights the evolutionary importance of plant secondary metabolites.</p>
