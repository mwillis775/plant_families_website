<h1>Martyniaceae</h1>
<p class="family-common-name">Unicorn Plant Family / Devil's Claw Family</p>
<p class="family-description">Martyniaceae is a small family of flowering plants in the order Lamiales (<strong>Asterids</strong>), primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the New World, especially arid areas. The family consists of annual or perennial herbs easily recognized by their covering of sticky <strong>glandular hairs</strong> and their highly distinctive, woody fruits equipped with hooks or horns ("claws") adapted for dispersal by animals (<strong>epizoochory</strong>).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Martyniaceae is a relatively small family, comprising about 5 genera and around 16 species. Its members are mostly robust, often sprawling, annual or perennial herbs. They are native mainly to the Americas, thriving in disturbed sites, fields, roadsides, and arid to semi-arid environments. Some species, particularly <i>Proboscidea louisianica</i>, have become naturalized weeds in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The entire plant surface is typically covered in sticky glandular hairs, giving them a slimy or clammy feel and often a distinct, sometimes unpleasant, odor. These hairs can trap small insects. The flowers are large, showy, and zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetrical), resembling those of related families like Bignoniaceae. However, the most unmistakable feature of the family is the fruit: a capsule or drupe-like structure whose fleshy outer layer eventually decays to reveal a hard, woody endocarp bearing formidable hooks, claws, or horns. These structures latch onto the fur or feet of passing animals, ensuring effective seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Some species have traditional uses; the young fruits of <i>Proboscidea</i> are sometimes pickled, and the dried woody fruits are used in crafts or basketry by indigenous peoples in the Americas.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Annual or perennial <strong>herbs</strong>, often coarse and sprawling. The entire plant (stems, leaves, flowers, fruits) is characteristically covered in viscous (sticky) <strong>glandular hairs</strong>, often giving off a distinct scent.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually <strong>opposite</strong> near the base of the plant, often becoming <strong>alternate</strong> higher up. They are simple, typically large and broad (often rounded, heart-shaped, or triangular), palmately veined, with margins that are entire or shallowly lobed. Petioles are usually long.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Flowers are borne in terminal <strong>racemes</strong>, which are often few-flowered.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are large, showy, <strong>zygomorphic</strong> (bilaterally symmetrical), and bisexual, typically 5-merous.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> 5 sepals, which can be free or fused at the base into a tube, sometimes spathe-like (split down one side). Often subtended by bractlets.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> 5 petals fused into a tube (<strong>sympetalous</strong>) that expands into an oblique, bell-shaped or funnel-shaped limb, often weakly <strong>bilabiate</strong> (two-lipped) with 5 lobes. Colors range from pink, purple, magenta, to yellowish or whitish, frequently with contrasting nectar guides (spots or lines) in the throat.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Typically consists of <strong>4 fertile stamens</strong> arranged in two pairs of unequal length (<strong>didynamous</strong>), plus usually a fifth, posterior stamen represented by a sterile <strong>staminode</strong> (sometimes absent). Stamens are attached to the corolla tube (epipetalous). Anthers often stick together (connivent) in pairs.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> The ovary is <strong>superior</strong>, composed of 2 fused carpels. It forms a single locule, but the <strong>parietal placentas</strong> (bearing the ovules) intrude deeply, sometimes meeting in the center to make it appear almost 2-locular. Ovules are numerous (or few in <i>Martynia</i>). A single slender style terminates in a sensitive, 2-lobed stigma that closes upon touch.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is highly distinctive and diagnostic for the family. It is a <strong>capsule</strong> or drupe-like fruit with a fleshy or leathery outer layer (exocarp) that eventually decays or wears away. This reveals a hard, woody inner layer (<strong>endocarp</strong>) that is elaborately sculptured with ridges, pits, and especially prominent spines or hooks. Typically, the endocarp terminates in two long, curved horns or claws (sometimes shorter spines). This woody structure with its hooks facilitates dispersal by attaching to animals (<strong>epizoochory</strong>). The fruit usually dehisces loculicidally along the crest between the horns. Seeds are relatively large, often flattened.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Martyniaceae are readily identified by their sticky hairs and unique fruits:</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sticky Glandular Hairs:</strong> The entire plant feels clammy or sticky due to dense glandular hairs. Often has a distinctive odor.</li>
<li><strong>Herbaceous Habit:</strong> Plants are non-woody annuals or perennials.</li>
<li><strong>Large, Showy Zygomorphic Flowers:</strong> Flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, often bell-shaped or two-lipped, resembling Bignoniaceae flowers.</li>
<li><strong>Distinctive Horned/Clawed Fruit:</strong> The woody fruit with long terminal hooks or claws is unmistakable and the most diagnostic feature (even when dried).</li>
<li><strong>Broad, Opposite/Alternate Leaves:</strong> Leaves are typically large, heart-shaped or rounded, opposite below and alternate above.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>4 Fertile Stamens (+ Staminode):</strong> Check inside the corolla tube.</li>
<li><strong>Superior Ovary:</strong> Ovary located above other floral parts.</li>
<li><strong>Habitat:</strong> Often found in open, disturbed, or arid/semi-arid areas in the Americas.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Typically during warmer, wetter periods (summer/monsoon season). Flowers are conspicuous.</li>
<li><strong>Fruiting Season:</strong> The unique woody fruits develop after flowering and persist for a long time, often found dried on the ground or attached to plants, making identification possible even after the plant has senesced.</li>
<li><strong>Vegetative Season:</strong> The sticky glandular hairs and broad leaves are characteristic even without flowers or fruits.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<p>While the fruit is unique, flowers and habit might resemble other families:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pedaliaceae (Sesame Family):</strong> Closely related; also often has glandular hairs and sometimes horned fruits (<i>Sesamum</i> capsules can have small points, <i>Harpagophytum</i> has grappling-hook fruits). Pedaliaceae often have axile placentation and differences in floral details.</li>
<li><strong>Bignoniaceae (Trumpet Creeper Family):</strong> Often has similar large, zygomorphic, trumpet-shaped flowers and opposite leaves, but Bignoniaceae are typically woody vines or trees, lack sticky glandular hairs covering the whole plant, and have very different fruits (usually long capsules with flat, winged seeds).</li>
<li><strong>Gesneriaceae (African Violet Family):</strong> Some have similar zygomorphic flowers, but are often epiphytic or rock-dwelling herbs, lack the pervasive sticky hairs, and have different fruit types.</li>
<li><strong>Lamiaceae (Mint Family):</strong> Have zygomorphic flowers and sometimes glandular hairs, but typically have square stems, opposite leaves throughout, and fruit consisting of 4 nutlets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Martyniaceae is placed within the large order <strong>Lamiales</strong>, a major group within the <strong>Asterid</strong> clade (specifically Lamiids or Euasterids I). This order includes many familiar families like mints (Lamiaceae), verbenas (Verbenaceae), snapdragons (Plantaginaceae), and trumpet creepers (Bignoniaceae).</p>
<p>Within Lamiales, Martyniaceae is very closely related to Pedaliaceae (Sesame family). These two families share features like glandular hairs and sometimes elaborate fruits adapted for animal dispersal. Some past classifications even included Martyniaceae within Pedaliaceae. Molecular data confirms their close relationship, placing them together in a well-supported clade, which is sister to or near other families like Acanthaceae (Acanthus family).</p>

<div class="related-families">
<h3>Related Families</h3>
<p>Within the order Lamiales, Martyniaceae's closest relatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pedaliaceae</strong> (Sesame family): Very closely related; often herbs with glandular hairs, zygomorphic flowers, superior ovary, fruit often a capsule or nut, sometimes with hooks or spines (<i>Harpagophytum</i>, <i>Sesamum</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Acanthaceae</strong> (Acanthus family): Large family, mostly herbs/shrubs with opposite leaves, often showy zygomorphic flowers frequently subtended by large bracts, characteristic cystoliths in leaves, and often explosive capsules.</li>
<li><strong>Bignoniaceae</strong> (Trumpet Creeper family): Mostly woody vines/trees with opposite compound leaves, large zygomorphic flowers, fruit usually a long capsule with winged seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Gesneriaceae</strong> (African Violet family): Often herbs/epiphytes, zygomorphic flowers, superior or inferior ovary, fruit usually a capsule or berry.</li>
<li><strong>Lamiaceae</strong> (Mint family): Herbs/shrubs often with square stems, opposite leaves, aromatic oils, zygomorphic flowers (usually 2-lipped), fruit of 4 nutlets.</li>
<li><strong>Plantaginaceae</strong> (Plantain family): Very diverse family including snapdragons, veronicas, plantains; highly variable morphology.</li>
<li><strong>Scrophulariaceae</strong> (Figwort family): Now smaller family, often herbs/shrubs with zygomorphic flowers.</li>
<li><strong>Orobanchaceae</strong> (Broomrape family): Includes parasitic plants (hemi- and holoparasites).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Martyniaceae, though small, is significant for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extreme fruit specialization:</strong> The horned/clawed woody fruit is a remarkable example of adaptation for epizoochory (dispersal via attachment to animals).</li>
<li><strong>Glandular hairs:</strong> The pervasive sticky glandular hairs likely serve defensive functions (trapping insects) and may relate to adaptation to arid environments.</li>
<li><strong>Pollination biology:</strong> The large, showy flowers with nectar guides and sensitive stigmas point to specialized pollination, likely by large bees.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship with Pedaliaceae:</strong> Provides insights into the evolution of shared traits (glandular hairs, specialized fruits) within this clade of Lamiales.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptation to disturbed habitats:</strong> Many species are successful colonizers of open or disturbed areas.</li>
