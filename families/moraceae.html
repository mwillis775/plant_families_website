<h1>Moraceae</h1>
<p class="guide-description"> Moraceae, the fig or mulberry family, is a significant family of eudicots in the order Rosales (Rosid clade), comprising about 40 genera and over 1,100 species. Primarily trees, shrubs, or lianas of tropical and subtropical regions (with some temperate members), they are characterized by the near-universal presence of milky latex, simple alternate leaves (often lobed) usually with prominent stipules that leave characteristic ring-like scars encircling the twig, and small, unisexual flowers densely aggregated into specialized inflorescences (e.g., spikes, heads, or the unique syconium of figs). The fruit is often a multiple fruit (syncarp) formed from the entire inflorescence.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Moraceae family is widely distributed, especially throughout tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. Its members play important ecological roles in forests as canopy trees, stranglers (<i>Ficus</i>), or pioneer species. The family holds considerable economic value. Figs (genus <i>Ficus</i>), with over 850 species, include the commercially important Common Fig (<i>Ficus carica</i>) as well as many ecologically crucial species in tropical ecosystems, known for their unique enclosed inflorescence (syconium) and obligate pollination mutualism with specific fig wasps. Mulberries (<i>Morus</i> spp.) are cultivated for their edible multiple fruits and for their leaves, which are the sole food source for silkworms. Breadfruit (<i>Artocarpus altilis</i>) and Jackfruit (<i>Artocarpus heterophyllus</i>) are staple food crops in tropical regions, providing large, starchy multiple fruits.</p>
<p>Osage Orange (<i>Maclura pomifera</i>), though having inedible fruit for humans, produces extremely durable wood and was historically important for making bows and dense, thorny hedges. Paper Mulberry (<i>Broussonetia papyrifera</i>) provides bark fiber used for traditional paper making in Asia and the Pacific. Most members of the family produce milky latex, sometimes used locally but not typically a source of commercial rubber like <i>Hevea</i> (Euphorbiaceae). Key identification features often include the presence of latex, alternate simple leaves, and stipule scars that completely encircle the twig.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma (current location as of March 27, 2025), the most prominent member is the native Osage Orange (<i>Maclura pomifera</i>), common in hedgerows and open areas. Red Mulberry (<i>Morus rubra</i>) is native to eastern and central Oklahoma woodlands, while the introduced White Mulberry (<i>Morus alba</i>) and Paper Mulberry (<i>Broussonetia papyrifera</i>) are often found in disturbed areas or urban settings, sometimes becoming weedy.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group"> <h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Mostly evergreen or deciduous trees and shrubs, some are lianas (climbers, often root climbers or stranglers like many <i>Ficus</i>), rarely herbs. Plants typically produce <b>milky latex</b> (sap), sometimes clear or yellowish, in specialized cells or canals (laticifers) throughout the plant.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually simple and arranged alternately and spirally (rarely opposite). Leaf blades are variable in shape, often entire but frequently palmately lobed (especially in <i>Morus</i>, <i>Broussonetia</i>, juvenile <i>Ficus</i>) or sometimes pinnately lobed. Venation is pinnate or palmate. A key feature is the presence of <b>stipules</b>, typically paired and often large, which enclose the terminal bud. These stipules are usually deciduous, falling off early and leaving behind characteristic <b>annular (ring-like) scars</b> that encircle the twig at each node.</p>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Moraceae twig showing alternate leaf and encircling stipule scar" src="../img/guides/moraceae-leaf-stipule-scar.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Typical Moraceae twig showing alternate simple leaf and characteristic stipule scar encircling the node.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Flowers are always unisexual and typically densely aggregated into specialized inflorescences, which vary among genera:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Syconium (<i>Ficus</i>):<i></i> A unique, fleshy, urn-shaped or globose receptacle that is entirely enclosed except for a small apical opening called an ostiole, which is lined with small bracts. Tiny male and female flowers line the inner cavity. Pollination occurs via specialized fig wasps that enter through the ostiole.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Spikes or Racemes:<i></i> Often catkin-like, dense spikes or racemes bearing either male or female flowers (<i>Morus</i>, <i>Broussonetia</i>).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Globose Heads:<i></i> Dense spherical heads bearing numerous male or female flowers (<i>Maclura</i>, some <i>Artocarpus</i>).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Discoid Receptacles:<i></i> Flattened, disc-like receptacles bearing flowers (<i>Dorstenia</i>).</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Cross-section of a Ficus syconium (fig)" src="../img/guides/ficus-syconium.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Unique syconium inflorescence of <i>Ficus</i>: a fleshy receptacle enclosing tiny unisexual flowers on the inner surface.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are small, inconspicuous, unisexual (plants monoecious or dioecious), actinomorphic, and typically lack petals (apetalous). Wind pollination occurs in some (<i>Morus</i>), but specialized insect pollination (e.g., fig wasps in <i>Ficus</i>) is common.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perianth:<i></i> Usually composed of 4-5 (sometimes 0-8) small, distinct or basally fused, sepal-like tepals. Often persistent and sometimes becoming fleshy and part of the multiple fruit.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Androecium (Male Flowers):<i></i> Stamens usually number as many as (and opposite to) the tepals (typically 4, sometimes 1-8). Filaments are sometimes inflexed (bent inwards) in bud and spring outwards elastically to release pollen (<i>Morus</i>). Anthers open by longitudinal slits. Pistillode may be present or absent.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium (Female Flowers):<i></i> Ovary is usually superior (sometimes inferior or embedded in receptacle), typically composed of 2 fused carpels but usually appearing unilocular by abortion or suppression. Contains a single apical or basal ovule. Styles usually 2 (sometimes 1), often slender or feathery.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The individual fruit is typically a small achene or drupe. However, because the flowers are densely clustered, the mature fruits, along with associated fleshy perianths and/or receptacle tissue, typically fuse together to form a <b>multiple fruit (syncarp)</b>. The structure of the syncarp reflects the inflorescence structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mulberry (<i>Morus</i>): An elongated syncarp formed from fleshy perianths surrounding individual drupes/achenes.</li>
<li>Osage Orange (<i>Maclura</i>): A large, globose, bumpy syncarp formed from fleshy receptacles and perianths surrounding drupes.</li>
<li>Fig (<i>Ficus</i>): The fleshy syconium itself, containing numerous tiny achenes (the true fruits) on the inside.</li>
<li>Breadfruit/Jackfruit (<i>Artocarpus</i>): Very large syncarps formed from the entire inflorescence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeds contain fleshy endosperm (sometimes scant) and often a curved or folded embryo.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>The presence of <b>laticifers</b> producing <b>milky latex</b> is characteristic of most members (though sometimes watery or sparse). The latex contains various compounds including triterpenes and sometimes alkaloids or cardiac glycosides (<i>Maclura</i>). Tannins and flavonoids are also common.</p>

<h2>Identification Basics</h2>
<p>Identifying Moraceae usually relies on the combination of woody habit, milky latex, alternate simple leaves, and characteristic annular stipule scars, confirmed by the unique inflorescences or multiple fruits.</p>
<div class="identification-feature"> <h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Woody Habit:<i></i> Mostly trees, shrubs, or lianas.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Milky Latex:<i></i> Usually exudes white sap when stems or leaves are broken (use caution).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Alternate, Simple Leaves:<i></i> (Often lobed in <i>Morus</i>, <i>Broussonetia</i>).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Annular Stipule Scars:<i></i> Scars left by fallen stipules completely encircle the twig at nodes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unisexual Flowers:<i></i> Plants monoecious or dioecious.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Aggregated Inflorescences:<i></i> Flowers tiny, densely packed into spikes, heads, or syconia (<i>Ficus</i>).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Multiple Fruit (Syncarp):<i></i> Individual fruits fused with fleshy parts into a larger structure (mulberry, fig, Osage orange).</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Syconium:<i></i> Presence of the unique fig inflorescence/fruit (<i>Ficus</i>).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Leaf Lobing:<i></i> Variable lobing patterns (<i>Morus</i>, <i>Broussonetia</i>, juvenile <i>Ficus</i>).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Thorns:<i></i> Presence of stout thorns (<i>Maclura</i>).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bark:<i></i> Characteristics of specific genera.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year-round:<i></i> Woody habit, alternate branching, annular stipule scars, and often milky latex are persistent features. Bark patterns helpful.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Spring/Summer:<i></i> Leaves present; inconspicuous flowers produced.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Summer/Fall:<i></i> Fruits (mulberries, figs, Osage oranges) mature and are highly distinctive.</strong></li>
<li><i>(Oklahoma Context: Osage Orange (</i>Maclura<i>) is easily recognized year-round by its thorny branches, furrowed bark, and large green multiple fruits in fall/winter. Mulberries (</i>Morus<i>) have distinctive variable leaves, milky sap, and produce fruit in early summer).</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Euphorbiaceae (Spurge Family):<i></i> Often have milky latex, alternate simple leaves, unisexual flowers. Key differences: Lack annular stipule scars; fruit typically a 3-parted schizocarpic capsule (not a syncarp); flowers sometimes in cyathia (<i>Euphorbia</i>).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Magnoliaceae (Magnolia Family):<i></i> Trees/shrubs with alternate simple leaves and annular stipule scars. Key differences: Lack milky latex; flowers large, bisexual, with numerous separate spiral parts; fruit an aggregate of follicles or samaras.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ulmaceae (Elm Family):<i></i> Trees/shrubs with alternate simple leaves. Key differences: Lack milky latex; lack annular stipule scars; leaves often asymmetric at base; flowers small but different structure; fruit a samara or drupe.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Platanaceae (Sycamore Family):<i></i> Trees with alternate lobed leaves and annular stipule scars. Key differences: Lack milky latex; bark distinctly patchy/exfoliating; flowers in dense spherical heads; fruit an aggregate of hairy achenes.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Key combination for Moraceae: Woody + Milky Latex + Alternate Simple Leaves + Annular Stipule Scars + Aggregated Unisexual Flowers + Multiple Fruit.</p>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Moraceae belongs to the order Rosales, within the Fabid (Eurosid I) clade of Rosids (Core Eudicots). Within Rosales, Moraceae is part of the "urticalean rosid" clade, which also includes Urticaceae (nettle family), Cannabaceae (hemp/hop family), and Ulmaceae (elm family). These families share characteristics like often simple leaves, reduced flowers, and single-seeded fruits, though Moraceae is distinguished by its milky latex and often specialized inflorescences/multiple fruits.</p>
<p>The family Moraceae itself is strongly monophyletic. The huge genus <i>Ficus</i>, with its unique enclosed syconium inflorescence and obligate pollination mutualism with specific agaonid wasps, represents a highly specialized lineage within the family. Other tribes group genera like <i>Morus</i>, <i>Artocarpus</i>, <i>Maclura</i>, and <i>Dorstenia</i> based on inflorescence type and other characters. The evolution of the syncarp (multiple fruit) from densely aggregated flowers has occurred multiple times and is a key theme in the family's reproductive biology and dispersal ecology.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="related-families"> <h3>Related Families (Rosales - Urticalean Clade)</h3>
<p>Within the order Rosales, Moraceae is closely related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urticaceae</strong> (Nettle family): Mostly herbs, often with stinging hairs, simple leaves with stipules, flowers tiny/unisexual/reduced, fruit an achene or drupe. Lack milky latex.</li>
<li><strong>Cannabaceae</strong> (Hemp/Hop family): Herbs or vines, often palmately lobed/compound leaves, unisexual flowers (often wind-pollinated), fruit an achene or drupe. Lack milky latex.</li>
<li><strong>Ulmaceae</strong> (Elm family): Trees/shrubs, simple alternate leaves often asymmetric base, flowers small/reduced, fruit a samara or drupe. Lack milky latex.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other families in the diverse Rosales order include Rosaceae, Rhamnaceae, Elaeagnaceae, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance"> <h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Moraceae showcases remarkable evolutionary innovations, particularly in reproductive structures. The syconium of <i>Ficus</i> represents one of the most intricate and obligate plant-pollinator mutualisms known, driving diversification in both figs and their specific wasp pollinators. The repeated evolution of the multiple fruit (syncarp) from different types of dense inflorescences highlights diverse pathways for developing fleshy, animal-dispersed diaspores. The prevalence of milky latex signifies the importance of chemical defenses in this lineage. As part of the large Rosales order, Moraceae contributes significantly to understanding the diversification of the Fabid clade of Rosids.</p>
