<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Myliaceae family, consisting solely of the genus <i>Mylia</i>, comprises a few species of relatively robust liverworts known for their distinct cellular structure and habitat preferences. Primarily distributed across temperate, boreal, and oceanic regions of the Northern Hemisphere (<i>M. taylorii</i> also occurs in the South), these plants are often conspicuous components of acidic, wet environments like peat bogs (frequently growing among <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses), wet heathlands, and moist acidic rock ledges.</p>
<p>Key identifying features include the succubously arranged, broadly rounded, entire (unlobed) leaves, the presence of small but distinct lanceolate or sometimes bifid underleaves, and notably large leaf cells and oil bodies, which can sometimes be discerned even with a hand lens. The plants often exhibit strong pigmentation, appearing yellowish-green, olive-brown, reddish-brown, or deep purplish-red. Fertile plants possess a large perianth that is characteristically flattened towards the mouth.</p>
<p>Phylogenetically, Myliaceae is placed within the Jungermanniales, suborder Jungermanniineae. Its unique combination of features, particularly the cellular gigantism, marks it as a distinct lineage whose relationships with other families like Plagiochilaceae and Jungermanniaceae continue to be explored.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Gametophyte Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Plants are medium-sized to large, often robust, typically forming loose prostrate to ascending mats or growing interwoven with <i>Sphagnum</i> and other bryophytes. Color is often distinctive, ranging from yellowish-green to olive-green, reddish-brown, or deep purplish-red, especially in exposed conditions. Stems are relatively thick, with branching variable but often sparse, typically lateral or ventral-intercalary.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves and Underleaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are arranged <b>succubously</b> and are typically closely overlapping (imbricate). They are broadly ovate to almost circular, with a distinctively <b>entire</b> (unlobed) and broadly <b>rounded apex</b>. Leaves are often concave. <b>Underleaves</b> are consistently <b>present</b>, though much smaller than the leaves; they are typically <b>lanceolate</b> to subulate (awl-shaped), sometimes bifid at the very tip, and usually appressed to the stem.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Rhizoids</h3>
<p>Rhizoids are numerous, long, often purplish or brownish, scattered along the ventral side of the stem, sometimes forming a dense mat.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Cellular Structure</h3>
<p>A highly distinctive feature: leaf cells are exceptionally <b>large</b> (often 40-60 µm wide or more in mid-leaf), typically hexagonal or polygonal. Cell walls are usually thin or slightly thickened, with <b>trigones generally small or indistinct</b>. <b>Oil bodies</b> are also very large and conspicuous, usually few per cell (1-3), coarsely granular or appearing botryoidal (like a cluster of grapes).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Asexual Reproduction</h3>
<p>Asexual reproduction via <b>gemmae</b> occurs in <i>Mylia anomala</i>, where multicellular, greenish gemmae are produced on the surfaces and margins of upper leaves. Gemmae are typically absent in <i>M. taylorii</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Reproductive Structures</h3>
<p>Plants are <b>dioicous</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antheridia</strong> are borne in the axils of saccate bracts, forming intercalary spikes on main stems.</li>
<li><strong>Archegonia</strong> are terminal on leading shoots, surrounded by several pairs of bracts that are similar to vegetative leaves but often larger.</li>
<li>A large, prominent <b>perianth</b> is present, typically long-exserted. It is usually cylindrical or fusiform at the base, becoming distinctly <b>dorsiventrally compressed</b> (flattened) and often somewhat bilabiate towards the wide mouth. The upper part is often plicate, and the mouth is typically crenulate or denticulate. <strong>Marsupia are absent</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Sporophytes and Spores</h3>
<p>The <strong>sporophyte</strong> develops within the perianth. The seta is long. The <strong>capsule</strong> is ovoid, dark brown, with a wall composed of multiple layers of cells. Dehiscence occurs via four valves.</p>

<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Myliaceae involves looking for robust liverworts with entire, rounded leaves and distinct underleaves, often in wet, acidic habitats. The large cell size is a key clue, sometimes visible with a strong hand lens.</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leaves:</strong> <b>Succubous</b>, broadly ovate to circular, <b>entire</b> with a <b>rounded apex</b>.</li>
<li><strong>Underleaves:</strong> Consistently <b>present</b>, typically <b>lanceolate</b> (sometimes bifid at tip), much smaller than leaves but usually visible.</li>
<li><strong>Cells:</strong> Exceptionally <b>large</b> (may appear granular or textured with hand lens).</li>
<li><strong>Habitat:</strong> Typically <b>acidic bogs</b> (often with <i>Sphagnum</i>), wet heathland, moist acidic rocks/logs.</li>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Often robust, with yellowish-green to reddish-brown or purplish hues.</li>
<li><strong>Perianth (if fertile):</strong> Large, <b>flattened towards the mouth</b>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil Bodies (Microscopic):</strong> Very large, few per cell.</li>
<li><strong>Gemmae:</strong> Present on leaves in <i>M. anomala</i>, absent in <i>M. taylorii</i>.</li>
<li><strong>Rhizoids:</strong> Often numerous, sometimes purplish.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<p>Myliaceae gametophytes are perennial:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year-Round:</strong> Vegetative features (leaf shape, underleaves, large cells) are constant. Plants are often conspicuous due to size and color.</li>
<li><strong>Habitat Moisture:</strong> Best observed when habitats are moist; bogs and heathlands may have seasonal water level changes.</li>
<li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Perianths and sporophytes may be found during favorable growing seasons. Gemmae on <i>M. anomala</i> can be present much of the year.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<p>The combination of entire rounded leaves, lanceolate underleaves, and large cells is distinctive:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jungermanniaceae (subg. <i>Jungermannia</i>):</strong> Also have entire, rounded leaves and succubous arrangement, but <b>lack underleaves</b> entirely and have significantly <b>smaller cells</b>. Perianth shape differs (typically cylindrical/fusiform, not flattened above).</li>
<li><strong>Plagiochilaceae (<i>Plagiochila</i>):</strong> Robust plants with succubous leaves, but leaves are typically asymmetric, often decurrent, toothed, and <b>underleaves are absent or minute/different</b>. Cells are smaller.</li>
<li><strong>Geocalycaceae (<i>Harpanthus</i>, some <i>Chiloscyphus</i>):</strong> Have underleaves present, but leaves are typically bilobed or retuse, not broadly rounded and entire. Cells are smaller.</li>
<li><strong>Nardiaceae (<i>Nardia</i>):</strong> Have entire or emarginate leaves and sometimes underleaves, but cells are smaller, often with very large trigones, and reproductive structures differ.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Myliaceae is classified within the liverwort division <strong>Marchantiophyta</strong>, class Jungermanniopsida, and order Jungermanniales. Its precise position within the order has been subject to some debate over time due to its unique combination of characters. However, recent molecular phylogenetic studies generally place it within the suborder <strong>Jungermanniineae</strong>, though potentially as a somewhat isolated lineage or perhaps related to families like Plagiochilaceae or Jungermanniaceae.</p>
<p>The family's distinctiveness is underscored by features such as the entire, rounded leaves coupled with lanceolate underleaves, the exceptionally large cells and oil bodies (cellular gigantism), and the dorsiventrally compressed perianth. These traits separate it clearly from the core groups of families like Lophoziaceae or Jungermanniaceae, supporting its recognition at the family level.</p>

<li><strong>Jungermanniaceae:</strong> Some members have entire leaves and lack underleaves, but differ significantly in cell size, oil bodies, and perianth shape.</li>
<li><strong>Lophoziaceae / Scapaniaceae:</strong> Also in Jungermanniineae, but clearly differ in having lobed or complicate-bilobed leaves, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Geocalycaceae:</strong> Belongs to a different suborder (Lophocoleineae) and has large, typically bifid underleaves.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Myliaceae is significant for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cellular Gigantism:</strong> Represents an extreme in large cell and oil body size within leafy liverworts, raising questions about its physiological implications.</li>
<li><strong>Ecological Specialization:</strong> Primarily adapted to acidic, wet, nutrient-poor environments like peat bogs and heathlands.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Morphology:</strong> The combination of entire rounded leaves, lanceolate underleaves, and compressed perianth marks a distinct evolutionary pathway.</li>
