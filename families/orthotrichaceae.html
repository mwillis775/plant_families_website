<h1>Orthotrichaceae</h1>
<p class="family-common-name">Bristle Moss / Orthotrichum Moss Family</p>
<p class="family-description">Orthotrichaceae is a large and widespread family of typically <strong>acrocarpous mosses</strong> that commonly form dense cushions or tufts. They are most frequently found as <strong>epiphytes</strong> on the bark of trees and shrubs, but many species also grow on rocks (epilithic). A characteristic feature of many species is the <strong>hairy (pilose) calyptra</strong> that covers the capsule, leading to the common name "bristle mosses". Capsules are often immersed or shortly exserted and frequently ribbed.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Orthotrichaceae family belongs to its own order, <strong>Orthotrichales</strong>. It is a large family containing around 15-20 genera and anywhere from 300 to over 600 species, depending on the taxonomic treatment, with <i>Orthotrichum</i> being the largest genus. The family is cosmopolitan, occurring from polar regions to the tropics, but is particularly diverse and abundant in temperate climates.</p>
<p>These mosses are typically well-adapted to exposed epiphytic or epilithic habitats, often showing considerable desiccation tolerance. Key features include the cushion or tuft-forming acrocarpous habit, lanceolate leaves often with recurved margins and papillose cells, immersed to shortly exserted capsules that are frequently ribbed when dry, and the often large, hairy, mitrate or campanulate calyptrae covering the capsules. The peristome structure is notably variable within the family.</p>
<p>Ecologically, Orthotrichaceae are very important primary colonizers and components of epiphytic and epilithic communities globally. They contribute to bark and rock weathering, provide microhabitats, and are indicators of air quality in some regions. Asexual reproduction via gemmae is common in some genera like <i>Zygodon</i> and <i>Ulota</i>.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics (Moss Morphology)</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Gametophyte: Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Plants are <strong>acrocarpous</strong>, typically forming dense cushions or tufts, sometimes small mats. Stems are erect to ascending, usually branched, often covered below with rhizoids.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Gametophyte: Stems</h3>
<p>Stems usually possess a central strand, though it can be weak or absent in some small species.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Gametophyte: Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are typically crowded, appressed to erect-spreading when dry (often more spreading or recurved in <i>Ulota</i>), spreading when moist. They are usually lanceolate, ovate-lanceolate, or oblong-lanceolate, often keeled. Leaf apices range from acute to obtuse or rounded. Margins are very often <strong>recurved or revolute</strong> (rolled backwards), usually entire or sometimes slightly toothed near the apex. The <strong>costa is single and strong</strong>, typically ending near the apex. Leaf cells are typically thick-walled; upper cells are often small, rounded-quadrate, isodiametric, or shortly rectangular, and frequently <strong>papillose</strong> (with simple or branched papillae); basal cells are usually longer, rectangular or quadrate, often clearer (hyaline) or colored, sometimes papillose.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Sporophyte: Seta, Capsule, Calyptra, and Peristome</h3>
<p>Sexual condition is typically autoicous or gonioautoicous (male buds at base of female branch), sometimes dioicous. The <strong>seta is usually short</strong>, resulting in the capsule being immersed among the perichaetial leaves, emergent, or shortly exserted (seta is longer in <i>Ulota</i>). The <strong>capsule</strong> is typically <strong>erect and symmetrical</strong>, ovoid to cylindric, and very often strongly <strong>ribbed (striate or plicate)</strong> when dry (8 or 16 ribs). Stomata are often present on the capsule neck, frequently superficial or immersed. The operculum is conical to rostrate. The <strong>calyptra</strong> (covering the young capsule) is large, conspicuous, typically conic-mitrate (cone-shaped, unslit) or campanulate (bell-shaped, lobed at base), often plicate, and frequently covered with erect or papillose <strong>hairs (pilose)</strong>. The <strong>peristome</strong> is highly variable, typically double but sometimes single or absent. Exostome teeth are 16, often grouped or fused in pairs (appearing as 8 compound teeth), frequently reflexed or recurved when dry. Endostome segments are typically 8 or 16, narrow, or sometimes rudimentary or absent. Cilia are generally absent.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Asexual Reproduction</h3>
<p>Asexual reproduction via multicellular <strong>gemmae</strong> produced on leaves or stems is common in some genera, such as <i>Zygodon</i> and <i>Ulota</i>.</p>

<h2>Field Identification (Mosses)</h2>
<p>Identifying Orthotrichaceae often relies on habitat, growth form, and sporophyte features, especially the calyptra:</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features (Field/Hand Lens)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habitat:</strong> Primarily epiphytic on tree bark (trunks, branches) or epilithic on rocks.</li>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Acrocarpous cushions or tufts.</li>
<li><strong>Capsules:</strong> Often immersed, emergent, or shortly exserted (except <i>Ulota</i>), typically erect and ribbed when dry.</li>
<li><strong>Hairy Calyptra:</strong> Look for conspicuous, often hairy, cap-like calyptrae covering young capsules (a very strong indicator if present).</li>
<li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Lanceolate, often with recurved margins (use lens), appressed or sometimes crisped (<i>Ulota</i>) when dry.</li>
<li><strong>Papillose cells:</strong> Leaves may appear somewhat dull due to papillae (confirm with microscope).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features (Microscope often needed)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cell shape and papillosity:</strong> Confirm upper cells small, thick-walled, often papillose; basal cells different.</li>
<li><strong>Leaf margin recurvature:</strong> Check extent of rolled margin.</li>
<li><strong>Capsule ribs and stomata:</strong> Observe number of ribs, presence and type of stomata (superficial vs. immersed).</li>
<li><strong>Peristome details:</strong> Examine exostome teeth (reflexed? paired?) and endostome structure (requires mature, open capsules).</li>
<li><strong>Gemmae:</strong> Look for small asexual propagules on leaves/stems in relevant genera.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points (Other Mosses)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pottiaceae (e.g., <i>Tortula, Syntrichia</i>):</strong> Many grow on bark/rock, form cushions, but often have leaves ending in hair points (awned), different cell structures (often highly papillose), and different peristomes.</li>
<li><strong>Grimmiaceae (e.g., <i>Grimmia, Schistidium</i>):</strong> Primarily rock-dwelling cushion mosses, often hoary (with hair points), capsules often immersed but peristomes are single or absent, calyptrae usually small and smooth.</li>
<li><strong>Leucodontaceae:</strong> Epiphytic/epilithic, but pleurocarpous with ecostate leaves and different sporophytes.</li>
<li><strong>Bryaceae (small epiphytic species):</strong> Acrocarpous, but usually have smooth cells, different leaf shapes, longer setae, inclined/pendent capsules, and typical Bryoid peristomes.</li>
<li><strong>Hedwigiaceae:</strong> Epilithic cushion mosses, often hoary, lack costa, have highly papillose cells, immersed capsules, and no peristome.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Orthotrichaceae is the principal family in the order <strong>Orthotrichales</strong>, class Bryopsida. This order is somewhat isolated phylogenetically among the acrocarpous mosses. While traditionally grouped with other acrocarps possessing double peristomes, molecular studies confirm its distinctness. Its exact relationships to other major moss orders remain somewhat unclear, though it's firmly within the Bryopsida.</p>
<p>Key evolutionary trends within the family include strong adaptation to epiphytic and epilithic life, resulting in desiccation tolerance mechanisms (e.g., leaf posture, papillosity, thick cell walls). The sporophyte shows considerable variation, particularly in the peristome structure (ranging from well-developed double to single or absent) and the frequent development of hairy, protective calyptrae. This variability suggests diverse adaptations related to spore protection and dispersal in exposed environments.</p>
