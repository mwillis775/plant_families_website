<h1>Oxalidaceae</h1>
<p class="family-common-name">Wood Sorrel Family</p>
<p class="family-description">Oxalidaceae, the wood sorrel family, is a diverse family of flowering plants in the order Oxalidales, comprising about 5-7 genera and around 750-800 species. The family is dominated by the large genus <i>Oxalis</i>. Members are mostly herbs, but also include shrubs and small trees, characterized by their often <strong>compound leaves</strong> (typically trifoliate) which frequently exhibit 'sleep movements' (nyctinasty) and a distinctive <strong>sour taste</strong> due to the presence of oxalic acid. The family has a <strong>cosmopolitan distribution</strong>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Oxalidaceae family is well-known for the genus <i>Oxalis</i>, commonly called wood sorrels or shamrocks (though true shamrocks are clovers in the Fabaceae family). These plants are widespread globally, found in diverse habitats from forests to grasslands and disturbed areas. Many species are recognized by their clover-like, palmately trifoliate leaves that fold down at night or in response to touch, and their characteristic sour flavor.</p>
<p>While predominantly herbaceous, often growing from bulbs, tubers, or rhizomes, the family also includes shrubs and notable small trees like <i>Averrhoa carambola</i> (starfruit). Flowers are typically 5-merous with 10 stamens, and many species of <i>Oxalis</i> exhibit heterostyly, a genetic mechanism promoting outcrossing. Fruits are often explosive capsules that forcefully eject seeds, though berries occur in <i>Averrhoa</i>.</p>
<p>Economically, the family includes edible species like oca (<i>Oxalis tuberosa</i>), an Andean tuber crop, and starfruit (<i>Averrhoa carambola</i>). Some <i>Oxalis</i> species are grown as ornamentals, while others are considered weeds in gardens and agriculture due to their persistence and vegetative propagation. The high oxalate content requires caution, as excessive consumption can be harmful.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Mostly <strong>herbs</strong> (annual or perennial), often possessing underground storage organs like <strong>bulbs, tubers, or rhizomes</strong>. Also includes some <strong>shrubs</strong> and small <strong>trees</strong> (e.g., <i>Averrhoa</i>). Some species can be climbing or acaulescent (stemless with basal leaves).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually <strong>alternate</strong> (sometimes basal or appearing whorled), and typically <strong>compound</strong>. Most commonly <strong>palmately trifoliate</strong> (like clover), but can also be pinnately compound (<i>Biophytum</i>, <i>Averrhoa</i>) or even unifoliate through reduction. Leaflets often possess basal <strong>pulvini</strong>, enabling nyctinastic ('sleep') movements where leaflets fold downwards at night or under stress. Stipules are present or absent. A <strong>sour taste</strong> due to oxalic acid is characteristic of many species.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Flowers can be solitary or arranged in various types of inflorescences, commonly <strong>cymes</strong> or <strong>umbel-like</strong> structures, often borne on long peduncles arising from the leaf axils or directly from the ground in acaulescent species.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are typically <strong>bisexual</strong>, <strong>actinomorphic</strong> (radially symmetrical), and <strong>5-merous</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Consists of <strong>5 distinct</strong> or slightly basally connate sepals, persistent.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Consists of <strong>5 distinct</strong> or slightly basally connate petals, often clawed, typically white, yellow, pink, rose, or violet. Petals are convolute (twisted) in bud.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Consists of <strong>10 stamens</strong> arranged in <strong>two whorls</strong> of 5. The outer whorl typically has shorter filaments than the inner whorl. Filaments are often <strong>connate at the base</strong>, forming a tube around the ovary.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> The ovary is <strong>superior</strong>, composed of <strong>5 fused carpels</strong> forming 5 locules. Placentation is axile, with usually 1 to many ovules per locule. There are <strong>5 distinct styles</strong>, each with a capitate or slightly bilobed stigma. <strong>Heterostyly</strong> (specifically tristyly or distyly) is common in many <i>Oxalis</i> species, involving different relative lengths of styles and stamens in different individuals to promote cross-pollination.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is most commonly a <strong>loculicidal capsule</strong>, which often dehisces explosively, ejecting the seeds. In the genus <i>Averrhoa</i>, the fruit is a fleshy, indehiscent <strong>berry</strong>. Seeds are small and often possess an <strong>aril</strong> (a fleshy appendage) that aids in dispersal, particularly in the explosive capsules where the aril turns inside out to eject the seed.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>The family is characterized by the presence of high concentrations of soluble and crystalline <strong>oxalates</strong> (salts of oxalic acid), particularly potassium oxalate. These compounds are responsible for the characteristic sour taste and can be toxic if consumed in large quantities, potentially leading to kidney problems.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying members of Oxalidaceae often relies on their distinctive leaves and flower structure:</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Usually <strong>compound</strong> (most often palmately trifoliate 'clover-like'), leaflets often notched at the apex, exhibiting <strong>sleep movements</strong> (folding down).</li>
<li><strong>Taste:</strong> Distinctly <strong>sour taste</strong> when a small part of a leaf is chewed (due to oxalates - use caution).</li>
<li><strong>Flowers:</strong> <strong>5-merous</strong> (5 sepals, 5 petals), with <strong>10 stamens</strong> (often fused at base) and <strong>5 distinct styles</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Mostly herbs, often low-growing, sometimes with bulbs or rhizomes.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit:</strong> Often an elongated <strong>capsule</strong> that may split explosively; sometimes a fleshy berry (<i>Averrhoa</i>).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heterostyly:</strong> In <i>Oxalis</i>, observing different flower forms within a population with varying style and stamen lengths (requires close examination of multiple plants).</li>
<li><strong>Petals:</strong> Often twisted (convolute) in bud.</li>
<li><strong>Stamens:</strong> Filaments often fused into a tube at the base; arranged in two whorls of different lengths.</li>
<li><strong>Seeds:</strong> Small, often ejected forcefully from capsules, sometimes with an aril.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spring/Summer/Fall:</strong> Most species flower during warmer months. Leaves are present throughout the growing season. Look for flowers and developing fruits.</li>
<li><strong>Winter:</strong> Many herbaceous species die back to underground bulbs, tubers, or rhizomes. Some evergreen species persist. Dried capsules might remain on some plants.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fabaceae (Legume family - Clovers):</strong> True clovers (<i>Trifolium</i>) also have trifoliate leaves but belong to Fabaceae. Clovers have distinctly different flowers (pea-like, often in dense heads), 10 stamens (usually 9 fused + 1 free), a single style, and fruit is a legume (pod). Clovers lack the sour taste.</li>
<li><strong>Geraniaceae (Geranium family):</strong> Some geraniums have palmately lobed or divided leaves. Flowers are also 5-merous, but typically have 5 or 10 stamens (not always in 2 distinct whorls) and a characteristic "crane's bill" fruit (schizocarp) that splits into 5 segments, often with coiled awns.</li>
<li>Other plants with trifoliate leaves: Always check flower structure (10 stamens, 5 styles) and taste for confirmation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Oxalidaceae is the namesake family of the order <strong>Oxalidales</strong>, which belongs to the fabid (or nitrogen-fixing) clade within the rosids group of eudicots. This placement is strongly supported by molecular data.</p>
<p>Within the Oxalidales, Oxalidaceae is sister to the family Connaraceae. The order Oxalidales also includes several other families, primarily woody plants like Cunoniaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Cephalotaceae (containing the unique Albany Pitcher Plant), and Brunelliaceae. The relationships among these families form a well-supported clade.</p>

<h3>Related Families (Order Oxalidales)</h3>
<p>Oxalidaceae is related to other families within the Oxalidales order, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connaraceae:</strong> Mostly tropical woody vines, shrubs, and trees with compound leaves and often asymmetrical flowers/fruits. Sister family to Oxalidaceae.</li>
<li><strong>Cunoniaceae:</strong> Trees and shrubs, primarily of the Southern Hemisphere, often with opposite, compound leaves and small flowers (e.g., Weinmannia).</li>
<li><strong>Elaeocarpaceae:</strong> Trees and shrubs found in tropical and subtropical regions, often with simple leaves and flowers bearing fringed petals or numerous stamens (e.g., Elaeocarpus).</li>
<li><strong>Cephalotaceae:</strong> Contains only one species, <i>Cephalotus follicularis</i> (Albany Pitcher Plant), a carnivorous plant endemic to southwestern Australia.</li>
<li><strong>Brunelliaceae:</strong> Trees with opposite, compound leaves, found in the Neotropics.</li>
<li><strong>Huaceae:</strong> Small family of trees and shrubs from tropical Africa.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Oxalidaceae showcases several interesting evolutionary features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chemical Defense/Adaptation:</strong> High oxalate concentration serves as a defense against herbivores but also requires physiological adaptations by the plant.</li>
<li><strong>Leaf Movements:</strong> Nyctinastic (sleep) movements of leaflets are well-developed and represent an adaptation possibly related to water conservation or temperature regulation. Thigmonasty (touch response) in <i>Biophytum</i> is also notable.</li>
<li><strong>Reproductive Strategies:</strong> Widespread occurrence of heterostyly in <i>Oxalis</i> is a classic example of a genetic mechanism promoting outcrossing. Explosive seed dispersal is an effective short-distance dispersal mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Life Form Diversity:</strong> Despite being dominated by herbs, the family shows diversity including bulbs, tubers, rhizomes, shrubs, and trees.</li>
<li><strong>Vegetative Propagation:</strong> Many herbaceous species rely heavily on bulbs, bulbils, or rhizomes for persistence and spread, contributing to their success as weeds or colonizers.</li>
