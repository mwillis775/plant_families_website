<h1>Pandanaceae</h1>
<p class="family-common-name">Screw Pine Family</p>
<p class="family-description">Pandanaceae is a family of <strong>monocotyledonous</strong> flowering plants in the order Pandanales, comprising 4 genera and about 800-900 species. Commonly known as screw pines (though unrelated to true pines), they are distinctive palm-like trees, shrubs, lianas, and epiphytes. They are characterized by their long, strap-like leaves arranged spirally at the branch tips and often supported by prominent <strong>stilt or prop roots</strong>. The family is primarily distributed in the Old World tropics.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Pandanaceae family is instantly recognizable by the genus <i>Pandanus</i>, the screw pines, which form iconic components of coastal vegetation, mangroves, and forests throughout the tropics of Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. The family also includes the large genus <i>Freycinetia</i>, which consists mainly of climbing lianas, and the less common genera <i>Sararanga</i> and <i>Martellidendron</i>.</p>
<p>These monocots are notable for their unique architecture, including dichotomous or sympodial branching, dense spiral clusters of long, narrow leaves often armed with spines, and conspicuous aerial prop roots that support the trunk. Plants are typically dioecious, bearing separate male and female inflorescences which are usually dense spikes or spadices subtended by bracts. The flowers themselves are highly reduced, lacking a perianth. Fruits are often large compound structures (syncarps) formed from fused drupes or berries.</p>
<p>Pandanaceae species play important ecological roles, particularly in coastal stabilization and providing habitat. They also have significant cultural and economic uses: leaves are widely used for weaving mats, baskets, and thatch; leaves of <i>Pandanus amaryllifolius</i> provide flavoring; and the fruits of some <i>Pandanus</i> species are edible.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Palm-like <strong>trees</strong>, <strong>shrubs</strong>, woody <strong>lianas</strong> (<i>Freycinetia</i>), or rarely epiphytes. Often characterized by thick, branching stems and prominent aerial <strong>stilt roots</strong> or <strong>prop roots</strong> emerging from the trunk and branches, providing support.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are <strong>simple</strong>, very long and narrow (<strong>strap-like</strong> or linear-lanceolate), stiff, and leathery. They are arranged <strong>spirally</strong> in three or four ranks, forming dense clusters at the tips of branches (giving the "screw" appearance). Leaf margins and often the underside of the midrib are typically armed with sharp <strong>spines or prickles</strong>. The leaf base is broad and sheathing. Venation is parallel, typical for monocots.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Inflorescences are terminal, typically dense, cylindrical or globose <strong>spikes</strong> or <strong>spadix-like</strong> structures. They are usually subtended by large, leaf-like or sometimes brightly colored <strong>bracts</strong>. Plants are typically <strong>dioecious</strong>, with separate male and female inflorescences.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are small, densely packed, inconspicuous, and <strong>unisexual</strong>. A distinct <strong>perianth (sepals/petals) is absent</strong> or reduced to minute scales or bristles.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Male Flowers:</strong> Consist of few to numerous <strong>stamens</strong>. Filaments can be free or fused. A rudimentary pistil (pistillode) may be present or absent.</li>
<li><strong>Female Flowers:</strong> Consist of a <strong>superior ovary</strong> composed of one to many carpels. Carpels can be free or fused together. Each carpel or locule contains one to many ovules. Stigmas are sessile (lacking a style), often broad, lobed, or horseshoe-shaped, located directly on the ovary apex. Staminodes may be present or absent.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is typically a large, globose or cylindrical <strong>multiple fruit (syncarp)</strong>. This compound structure is formed from the aggregation of numerous individual, often fleshy or fibrous, <strong>drupes</strong> or <strong>berries</strong> (sometimes called phalanges), which may be free or fused together. Each segment usually develops from a single carpel or a group of fused carpels. Seeds are small, with oily endosperm.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Calcium oxalate crystals (raphides) are common in tissues. Some species, notably <i>Pandanus amaryllifolius</i>, produce aromatic compounds (like 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline) responsible for their characteristic fragrance used in cooking.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Pandanaceae is usually straightforward due to their highly distinctive vegetative features:</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Palm-like tree or shrub, often with prominent <strong>prop roots</strong> or stilt roots. Can also be a woody liana (<i>Freycinetia</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Long, narrow, <strong>strap-like</strong> leaves arranged <strong>spirally</strong> in dense tufts at branch ends.</li>
<li><strong>Leaf Armature:</strong> Margins and often midrib beneath armed with sharp <strong>spines/prickles</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Inflorescence/Fruit:</strong> Dense terminal spikes/spadices often with large bracts, developing into large, compound <strong>syncarps</strong> (multiple fruits resembling pineapples or cones).</li>
<li><strong>Reproductive System:</strong> Plants are <strong>dioecious</strong> (separate male and female individuals).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branching Pattern:</strong> Often dichotomous or pseudo-dichotomous.</li>
<li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Small, unisexual, lacking obvious petals or sepals, densely packed in spadices.</li>
<li><strong>Habitat:</strong> Common in coastal areas, mangroves, swamps, and rainforests in the Old World tropics.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year-round:</strong> The distinctive habit, prop roots, and spiral, spiny leaves are identifiable throughout the year.</li>
<li><strong>Flowering/Fruiting Period:</strong> Inflorescences and the large syncarps are conspicuous when present and confirm identification. Fruiting times vary by species and location.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<p>While very distinctive, confusion might occur with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Palms (Arecaceae):</strong> Some palms have stilt roots or spiny leaves, but palms typically have large, pinnately or palmately compound leaves (not simple strap-like leaves arranged spirally) and very different flower/fruit structures (often panicles of small flowers, fruits are usually simple drupes or berries).</li>
<li><strong>Dracaena / Cordyline (Asparagaceae):</strong> Some species have strap-like leaves clustered at stem tips, but lack prop roots and spiny leaf margins, and have typical monocot flowers with perianth parts, and berry fruits.</li>
<li><strong>Cyclanthaceae:</strong> Related family, some members are palm-like or climbers with different leaf shapes (often bifid or fan-shaped) and spadix inflorescences, but details of flower and fruit structure differ. Found mainly in the Neotropics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Pandanaceae is the largest family in the monocot order <strong>Pandanales</strong>. This order is part of the broader commelinid clade but stands somewhat apart from the major groups like Poales (grasses), Arecales (palms), and Zingiberales (gingers). Molecular data strongly supports the monophyly of Pandanaceae and its placement within Pandanales.</p>
<p>Within the order Pandanales, Pandanaceae is most closely related to Cyclanthaceae (a primarily Neotropical family of palm-like plants and climbers) and Stemonaceae (herbs and climbers with net-venation, mostly Asian). The order also includes the families Velloziaceae (xerophytic shrubs, often with persistent leaf bases) and Triuridaceae (achlorophyllous mycoheterotrophic herbs).</p>

<h3>Related Families (Order Pandanales)</h3>
<p>Pandanaceae shares the order Pandanales with four other families:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cyclanthaceae</strong>: Palm-like herbs or root-climbing lianas, mostly Neotropical, often with bifid or fan-shaped leaves (e.g., <i>Carludovica</i>, used for Panama hats). Sister or near-sister to Pandanaceae.</li>
<li><strong>Stemonaceae</strong>: Herbaceous plants or climbers, often with tuberous roots and distinctive net-veined leaves (unusual for monocots).</li>
<li><strong>Velloziaceae</strong>: Drought-adapted shrubs or treelets, often with fibrous persistent leaf sheaths covering the stem, found in South America and Africa.</li>
<li><strong>Triuridaceae</strong>: Small, non-photosynthetic (achlorophyllous) mycoheterotrophic herbs found in tropical forests worldwide.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Pandanaceae is significant for several evolutionary reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monocot Diversity:</strong> Represents a distinct and successful lineage of arborescent (tree-like) and climbing monocots outside of the palms (Arecales).</li>
<li><strong>Morphological Adaptations:</strong> Features like prop roots, spiny strap-leaves, and compound fruits (syncarps) represent adaptations to specific environments (e.g., coastal, swampy) and dispersal strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Floral Reduction:</strong> The highly reduced flowers lacking a perianth illustrate a trend seen in some densely aggregated inflorescences where visual attraction shifts to bracts or the entire structure.</li>
<li><strong>Biogeography:</strong> Its predominantly Old World tropical distribution, with centers of diversity in Malesia and the Pacific, provides insights into monocot evolution and dispersal across island systems.</li>
<li><strong>Ecological Roles:</strong> Important structural components of many tropical ecosystems, particularly coastal strand and mangrove communities.</li>
