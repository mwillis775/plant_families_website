<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Passifloraceae family is most famous for the genus <i>Passiflora</i>, which includes both the stunningly complex passion flowers, admired ornamentally, and the commercially important passion fruit (<i>Passiflora edulis</i>). The intricate structure of the passion flower, particularly the corona (a fringe or series of appendages between the petals and stamens), fascinated early botanists and was interpreted symbolically by missionaries.</p>
<p>Most members are climbers, using tendrils that arise from the leaf axils (representing modified inflorescences) to support themselves. Leaves are typically alternate and often palmately lobed, frequently bearing nectar glands on the petiole or blade that attract ants, potentially for defense. The family, in its current broad sense (APG IV), incorporates two other groups, formerly treated as separate families: Turneraceae (mostly herbs and shrubs like <i>Turnera</i>, often with yellow flowers) and Malesherbiaceae (herbs and subshrubs from South America). This expanded circumscription reflects strong molecular evidence of their close relationship.</p>
<p>Economically, besides passion fruit, the family is significant for its many ornamental species of <i>Passiflora</i>. Some species are used in traditional medicine, containing compounds like cyanogenic glycosides and alkaloids (e.g., harman alkaloids in some <i>Passiflora</i>).</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Mostly perennial <strong>vines</strong> or <strong>lianas</strong> climbing by means of axillary <strong>tendrils</strong> (modified inflorescences or shoots). Also includes herbs, shrubs, and small trees (especially in subfamily Turneroideae).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually <strong>alternate</strong> (rarely opposite), simple or compound (palmately or pinnately), often <strong>palmately lobed</strong> (3-9 lobes). <strong>Stipules</strong> are typically present, varying from small and thread-like to large and leaf-like. Petioles or leaf blades frequently bear conspicuous extrafloral <strong>nectar glands</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Flowers are often solitary in leaf axils or arranged in cymes or racemes. Tendrils often arise from the same axil as the inflorescence.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are usually bisexual (sometimes unisexual), <strong>actinomorphic</strong> (radially symmetrical), often large, showy, and complex. A <strong>hypanthium</strong> (floral cup or tube) is typically present. Stamens and/or ovary are often elevated on a stalk (<strong>androgynophore</strong> or <strong>gynophore</strong>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sepals:</strong> Usually <strong>5</strong>, distinct or fused at the base, often persistent and sometimes petal-like in color.</li>
<li><strong>Petals:</strong> Usually <strong>5</strong>, distinct, alternating with the sepals, arising from the rim of the hypanthium. Sometimes absent.</li>
<li><strong>Corona:</strong> A highly characteristic structure typically present inside the petals, arising from the hypanthium. It consists of one or more whorls of diverse appendages: filaments, threads, membranes, scales, or tubercles. Its form is highly variable and diagnostic for species/groups.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens typically <strong>5</strong> (sometimes 3-many), often borne on an androgynophore. Filaments are usually fused at the base, forming a tube around the gynophore. Anthers are often large and versatile (attached near the middle, movable).</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> Ovary is <strong>superior</strong>, typically borne on a gynophore (or androgynophore). It is composed of <strong>3</strong> (rarely 4-5) fused carpels forming a <strong>single locule</strong> (unilocular) with <strong>parietal placentation</strong> (ovules attached to the ovary wall). Ovules are numerous. Styles are usually <strong>3</strong> (matching carpel number), distinct or fused at the base; stigmas are often large and capitate (head-like) or discoid.</li>
<li>(Note: Subfamilies Turneroideae and Malesherbioideae have variations, e.g., Turneroideae often lack a prominent corona and gynophore, may show heterostyly).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is typically a many-seeded <strong>berry</strong> (e.g., passion fruit) or a <strong>capsule</strong> that dehisces loculicidally or septicidally. Seeds are flattened, often pitted or reticulated, and characteristically enclosed in a fleshy, often brightly colored <strong>aril</strong> derived from the funiculus (seed stalk).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Many species produce <strong>cyanogenic glycosides</strong> as a defense mechanism. Flavonoids are common. Some <i>Passiflora</i> species contain <strong>harman-type alkaloids</strong>, which have sedative properties and contribute to the traditional use of some species (like <i>P. incarnata</i>) for anxiety and insomnia.</p>

<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Passifloraceae, especially the genus <i>Passiflora</i>, often relies on recognizing their climbing habit and unique flower structure:</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Mostly <strong>vines/lianas</strong> climbing with axillary <strong>tendrils</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Usually <strong>alternate</strong>, often palmately lobed, frequently with glands on the petiole or blade.</li>
<li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Distinctive and complex; typically 5 sepals, 5 petals, a prominent <strong>corona</strong> (filamentous or membranous appendages inside petals), usually 5 stamens often fused around a stalk (<strong>androgynophore/gynophore</strong>) supporting the superior ovary with usually 3 styles/stigmas.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit:</strong> A <strong>berry</strong> or <strong>capsule</strong> containing numerous seeds, each typically covered by a fleshy <strong>aril</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stipules:</strong> Present, variable in size and shape.</li>
<li><strong>Flower Stalk:</strong> Presence of an androgynophore or gynophore elevating the stamens/ovary.</li>
<li><strong>Placentation:</strong> Parietal (ovules on the ovary wall).</li>
<li><strong>Subfamily Turneroideae (e.g., <i>Turnera</i>):</strong> Often herbs/shrubs (not vines), flowers simpler (lacking prominent corona/gynophore), often yellow, sometimes heterostylous.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flowering Period:</strong> Varies greatly by species and climate, but flowers are essential for identification, especially the corona structure. Many tropical species flower year-round or intermittently.</li>
<li><strong>Fruiting Period:</strong> Berries (passion fruits) or capsules develop after flowering. The arillate seeds inside are characteristic.</li>
<li><strong>Vegetative State:</strong> The combination of climbing habit with tendrils and alternate, often lobed leaves with petiolar glands strongly suggests Passifloraceae.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cucurbitaceae (Gourd Family):</strong> Also often vines with tendrils and lobed leaves. However, Cucurbitaceae tendrils are typically branched and arise near the petiole base (not truly axillary), flowers are usually unisexual, lack a corona, have an inferior ovary, and fruits are pepos (modified berries like cucumbers, melons).</li>
<li><strong>Vitaceae (Grape Family):</strong> Vines with tendrils, but tendrils are typically opposite the leaves, flowers are small and inconspicuous in panicles, lack a corona, and fruit is a simple berry (grape).</li>
<li>Other climbing plants: Check for the presence of axillary tendrils, characteristic leaf shape/glands, and especially the unique flower structure (corona, gynophore).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Passifloraceae is placed within the large order <strong>Malpighiales</strong>, part of the fabid clade of rosids. Molecular studies have significantly reshaped the understanding of this family's boundaries.</p>
<p>The APG system now recognizes Passifloraceae in a broad sense (<i>sensu lato</i>), including the genera formerly placed in Turneraceae and Malesherbiaceae. These three groups form a strongly supported monophyletic clade. Within this expanded family, they are often treated as subfamilies: Passifloroideae (containing <i>Passiflora</i> and relatives), Turneroideae (containing <i>Turnera</i>, <i>Piriqueta</i>, etc.), and Malesherbioideae (containing only <i>Malesherbia</i>). Within the Malpighiales order, the Passifloraceae clade is closely related to families like Violaceae (violets) and Salicaceae (willows).</p>

<h3>Related Families (Order Malpighiales)</h3>
<p>Passifloraceae is part of the large Malpighiales order. Its closest relatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Violaceae</strong> (Violet family): Mostly herbs (like violets) but also shrubs/trees, often with zygomorphic flowers featuring a spurred lower petal.</li>
<li><strong>Salicaceae</strong> (Willow family): Includes willows, poplars, and many tropical trees/shrubs formerly in Flacourtiaceae. Often dioecious, flowers often in catkins.</li>
<li><strong>Euphorbiaceae</strong> (Spurge family): Highly diverse, often with latex, unisexual flowers (sometimes in cyathia), and typically 3-lobed capsular fruits.</li>
<li><strong>Phyllanthaceae</strong>: Segregated from Euphorbiaceae s.l., trees/shrubs usually lacking latex, often 2 ovules per ovary locule.</li>
<li><strong>Rhizophoraceae</strong> (Mangrove family): Trees/shrubs, including mangroves often with prop roots or viviparous seedlings.</li>
<li>(And many others like Linaceae, Erythroxylaceae, Clusiaceae, Hypericaceae, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance">
<h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Passifloraceae is notable for several evolutionary aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Floral Complexity and Pollination Syndromes:</strong> The highly specialized flowers, particularly the corona, are linked to specific pollinators (large bees, hummingbirds, bats). The family provides excellent examples of co-evolution between plants and pollinators.</li>
<li><strong>Evolution of Climbing Habit:</strong> The development of axillary tendrils facilitated the diversification of climbing forms, allowing exploitation of new ecological niches.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Defenses:</strong> Widespread occurrence of cyanogenic glycosides and unique alkaloids represents diverse strategies against herbivores.</li>
<li><strong>Inclusion of Turneraceae/Malesherbiaceae:</strong> Demonstrates how molecular data can unite morphologically disparate groups, revealing deeper evolutionary connections (e.g., linking tendrilled vines with complex flowers to herbs/shrubs with simpler flowers).</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Diversification:</strong> The genus <i>Passiflora</i>, in particular, has undergone extensive and relatively recent diversification, especially in the Neotropics.</li>
