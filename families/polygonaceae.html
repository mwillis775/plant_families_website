<h1>Polygonaceae</h1>
<p class="guide-description"> Polygonaceae, the buckwheat, knotweed, or smartweed family, is a moderately large family of eudicots in the order Caryophyllales, containing about 50-65 genera and over 1,100 species. Found worldwide but most diverse in temperate regions, members are typically herbs (sometimes shrubs or vines) characterized by swollen stem nodes and the presence of a unique stipular sheath called an <b>ocrea</b> encircling the stem above each node. Flowers are generally small, lack true petals but often have petaloid tepals, possess a superior ovary with a single basal ovule, and mature into a triangular or lens-shaped achene, frequently enclosed by the persistent perianth.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Polygonaceae family is globally distributed, thriving in habitats ranging from wetlands and disturbed areas to alpine slopes and arid deserts (especially the genus <i>Eriogonum</i> in western North America). The single most defining feature of the family is the <b>ocrea</b>, a tubular sheath formed from fused stipules that surrounds the stem at the base of the petiole – its presence is nearly universal and highly diagnostic. Stems often appear jointed due to swollen nodes where the leaves (and ocreae) attach.</p>
<p>Economically, the family includes important food crops like buckwheat (<i>Fagopyrum esculentum</i>), cultivated for its grain-like seeds, and rhubarb (<i>Rheum rhabarbarum</i>), grown for its edible, tart petioles (leaf stalks). Many species are familiar wildflowers or weeds, including smartweeds (<i>Persicaria</i>), knotweeds (<i>Polygonum</i> sensu lato, including invasive species like Japanese Knotweed <i>Reynoutria japonica</i> formerly in <i>Polygonum</i>), docks, and sorrels (<i>Rumex</i>). Some <i>Eriogonum</i> species are cultivated as ornamentals for dry gardens. The sour taste of sorrel and rhubarb is due to high concentrations of oxalic acid, common in the family. Anthraquinone pigments also occur, providing red colors and sometimes having laxative effects (<i>Rheum</i>).</p>
<p>In Oklahoma (current location as of March 27, 2025), the family is well-represented, primarily by numerous native and weedy species of smartweeds/knotweeds (<i>Persicaria</i>, <i>Polygonum</i>) in moist or disturbed areas, docks (<i>Rumex</i>) in fields and roadsides, and potentially some Wild Buckwheats (<i>Eriogonum</i>) in drier western parts of the state. Buckwheat and Rhubarb are cultivated food plants, not native.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group"> <h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Mostly annual or perennial herbs, some are shrubs, vines (<i>Fallopia</i>), or rarely trees. Stems are often distinctly jointed with <b>swollen nodes</b>.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves and Ocrea</h3>
<p>Leaves are almost always <b>alternate</b> (rarely opposite/whorled), <b>simple</b>, and typically have entire margins (though sometimes lobed or crenate). Venation is pinnate. The most diagnostic feature is the presence of an <b>ocrea</b> (plural: ocreae): a sheath, typically membranous or papery (sometimes leathery or leafy), that surrounds the stem immediately above the node where the petiole attaches. It is formed from fused stipules. The ocrea's size, texture, persistence, and margin characteristics (e.g., entire, lacerate, fringed with bristles) are important for identification.</p>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram showing stem node with alternate leaf and ocrea" src="../img/guides/polygonaceae-ocrea.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Characteristic Polygonaceae node: Alternate simple leaf with an ocrea (stipular sheath) encircling the stem above the petiole base.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Flowers are generally small but often aggregated into conspicuous inflorescences. These are highly variable, including terminal or axillary racemes, panicles, spikes (often dense and narrow in <i>Persicaria</i>), or head-like clusters, often composed of smaller cymose units (fascicles). In <i>Eriogonum</i>, flowers are typically clustered within a distinct cup-like involucre composed of fused bracts.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are small, usually bisexual (sometimes unisexual), typically actinomorphic (radially symmetric), and hypogynous. They lack true petals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perianth:</strong> Composed of (3-) 5 or 6 <b>tepals</b> (sepal-like or often petaloid), arranged in one or two whorls (e.g., 5 in one whorl, or 3+3). Tepals are distinct or fused only at the base, usually greenish, whitish, pinkish, or reddish. A key feature is that the tepals are typically <b>persistent</b> and often enlarge, become winged, hooked, fleshy, or hardened around the developing fruit, playing a role in dispersal.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens usually number 3-9 (often 6 or 8), typically arranged in two whorls. Filaments are distinct or slightly fused at the base, arising from the receptacle or perianth base. Nectar glands often form a disc around the base of the ovary.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> Ovary is <b>superior</b>, composed of typically 2 or 3 fused carpels, forming a single locule containing a <b>single basal ovule</b>. Styles typically 2 or 3, distinct or fused below; stigmas variable, often capitate or tufted.</li>
</ul>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram of Polygonaceae flower and fruit" src="../img/guides/polygonaceae-flower-fruit.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Left: Small flower with 5-6 tepals, 6-9 stamens, superior ovary. Right: Achene (triangular or lens-shaped) often enclosed by persistent, modified tepals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The characteristic fruit is a dry, indehiscent, single-seeded <b>achene</b> (or nutlet). Reflecting the gynoecium structure, the achene is typically <b>triangular</b> (trigonous, if from 3 carpels) or <b>lens-shaped</b> (lenticular/biconvex, if from 2 carpels). The achene is frequently enclosed or subtended by the persistent and often modified perianth (tepals). These modified tepals can form wings (<i>Rumex</i>), hooks (<i>Rumex</i> sometimes), or become fleshy, aiding wind, water, or animal dispersal. The seed has a straight or curved embryo and abundant starchy endosperm (unlike the perisperm found in many other Caryophyllales families).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Many species contain <b>oxalic acid</b> or soluble oxalates, contributing to a sour taste (<i>Rumex</i> - sorrels, <i>Rheum</i> - rhubarb). <b>Anthraquinones</b> are common, especially in roots (<i>Rumex</i>, <i>Rheum</i>), providing reddish/yellow pigments and sometimes laxative properties. Tannins and flavonoids are also widespread. Unlike most core Caryophyllales families, Polygonaceae produce <b>anthocyanin</b> pigments (not betalains) for red/purple coloration, a trait shared with Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae within the order.</p>

<h2>Identification Basics</h2>
<p>Identifying Polygonaceae almost always relies on finding the characteristic ocrea at the nodes, combined with other features like alternate simple leaves, small flowers with persistent tepals, and achene fruits.</p>
<div class="identification-feature"> <h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ocrea Present:</strong> A membranous or papery sheath encircling the stem above the node (formed from fused stipules). This is the most diagnostic feature.</li>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Mostly herbs (sometimes vines or shrubs).</li>
<li><strong>Swollen Nodes:</strong> Stems often appear jointed or swollen at the nodes where leaves attach.</li>
<li><strong>Alternate Simple Leaves:</strong> Leaves typically alternate, simple, often entire.</li>
<li><strong>Small Apetalous Flowers:</strong> Flowers lack true petals; perianth of (3-)5-6 persistent tepals (often petaloid).</li>
<li><strong>Superior Ovary (1 Locule, 1 Basal Ovule):</strong> Leading to a single seed.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit an Achene:</strong> Dry, single-seeded, typically triangular or lens-shaped, often enclosed by persistent tepals.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ocrea Margin:</strong> Entire, torn (lacerate), or fringed with bristles.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Perianth Modification:</strong> Tepals becoming winged, hooked, or fleshy around the fruit (<i>Rumex</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Achene Shape:</strong> Triangular vs. Lens-shaped.</li>
<li><strong>Inflorescence Type:</strong> Racemes, panicles, spikes, heads (sometimes involucrate in <i>Eriogonum</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Sour Taste:</strong> Often present in leaves/stems (<i>Rumex</i>).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growing Season:</strong> Ocreae, alternate leaves, and swollen nodes are visible. Flowering occurs spring through fall.</li>
<li><strong>Late Season/Winter:</strong> The persistent perianth enclosing the achene is highly diagnostic and often remains on dead stems through winter (especially prominent in <i>Rumex</i>). Dried stems may still show swollen nodes and remnants of ocreae.</li>
<li><i>(Oklahoma Context: Knotweeds/Smartweeds (</i>Polygonum<i>, </i>Persicaria<i>) and Docks (</i>Rumex<i>) are common weeds flowering/fruiting through summer and fall; their distinctive fruits often persist. Look for ocreae on any suspect plant).</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amaranthaceae / Chenopodiaceae:</strong> Also Caryophyllales, often herbaceous weeds with alternate simple leaves, small apetalous flowers with persistent tepals, superior ovary with single basal ovule, achene/utricle fruit. Key difference: Amaranthaceae <b>lack an ocrea</b>. Nodes not typically as swollen; perisperm present in seed.</li>
<li><strong>Caryophyllaceae (Pink Family):</strong> Often herbaceous with swollen nodes, superior ovary. Key differences: Leaves usually opposite; lack ocrea; flowers have distinct petals (often notched); fruit a capsule with multiple seeds on free-central placenta.</li>
<li><strong>Other families with small flowers/alternate leaves:</strong> Check carefully for the presence of the ocrea at the nodes. This feature is largely unique to Polygonaceae.</li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of the <b>ocrea</b> is the single most reliable field mark for identifying Polygonaceae.</p>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Polygonaceae is placed in the large order Caryophyllales (Core Eudicots). Its exact position within the order is subject to some variation in phylogenetic analyses, but it is often placed within the core Caryophyllales clade, potentially sister to Plumbaginaceae (leadwort family) or part of a broader group including carnivorous families (<strong>Droseraceae</strong>, <strong>Nepenthaceae</strong>) and Tamaricaceae/Frankeniaceae. Notably, Polygonaceae is one of the few families within the core Caryophyllales (along with Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae) that produce anthocyanin pigments rather than the betalains characteristic of most other families in the core group (e.g., Amaranthaceae, Cactaceae, Aizoaceae).</p>
<p>The family itself is strongly monophyletic, clearly defined by the presence of the ocrea. Internal relationships have led to the recognition of several subfamilies, with Eriogonoideae (<i>Eriogonum</i>) often diverging early, lacking typical ocreae found in Polygonoideae (<i>Polygonum</i>, <i>Rumex</i>, <i>Persicaria</i>, <i>Fallopia</i>, <i>Fagopyrum</i>, <i>Rheum</i>, etc.). The evolution of the persistent and often modified perianth surrounding the achene fruit is a key theme related to diverse dispersal strategies (wind, water, animal attachment/ingestion) within the family.</p>
<div class="phylogeny-position"> <h3>Position in Plant Phylogeny</h3>

</div>
<div class="related-families"> <h3>Related Families (Caryophyllales)</h3>
<p>Within the order Caryophyllales, Polygonaceae is related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plumbaginaceae</strong> (<em>Leadwort / Sea Lavender family</em>): Often herbs/shrubs of saline/dry habitats, flowers 5-merous with persistent calyx, sympetalous corolla, superior ovary with basal ovule.</li>
<li><strong>Droseraceae</strong> (<em>Sundew family</em>) &amp; <strong>Nepenthaceae</strong> (<em>Tropical Pitcher Plant family</em>): Carnivorous plants, representing specialized lineages within the order.</li>
<li><strong>Tamaricaceae</strong> (<em>Tamarisk family</em>) &amp; <strong>Frankeniaceae</strong> (<em>Sea Heath family</em>): Often adapted to saline/dry conditions.</li>
<li>More distantly related to the core betalain-producing families: Amaranthaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Cactaceae, Aizoaceae, Nyctaginaceae, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance"> <h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Polygonaceae is significant for its unique morphological synapomorphy, the ocrea, which clearly defines the family. Its phylogenetic position within Caryophyllales, possessing anthocyanins rather than the betalains typical of the core clade, provides important clues about pigment evolution within the order. The family demonstrates successful adaptation to a wide range of habitats, from wetlands (<i>Persicaria</i>) to deserts (<i>Eriogonum</i>), often characterized by weedy or colonizing strategies. The diversification of fruit dispersal mechanisms involving the persistent perianth highlights evolutionary ingenuity in seed propagation.</p>
