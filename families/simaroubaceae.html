<h1>Simaroubaceae</h1>
<p class="family-common-name">Quassia Family / Tree-of-heaven Family</p>
<p class="family-description"><i>Simaroubaceae</i> is a family of trees and shrubs belonging to the order <strong><i>Sapindales</i></strong>. Distributed mainly in the tropics but extending into temperate zones, its members often possess <strong>pinnately compound leaves</strong> and are known for producing intensely <strong>bitter compounds</strong> (quassinoids). Flowers are typically small and often unisexual, developing into fruits that are frequently aggregates of samaras or drupes. The family includes the infamous invasive Tree-of-heaven (<i>Ailanthus altissima</i>) and the medicinal genus <i>Quassia</i>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <i>Simaroubaceae</i> family is placed within the large and economically important order <strong><i>Sapindales</i></strong>, which also includes families like Rutaceae (citrus), Anacardiaceae (cashew, mango, poison ivy), and Sapindaceae (maples, lychee). Simaroubaceae itself comprises about 20-25 genera and 100-120 species of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>The family exhibits a primarily <strong>pantropical distribution</strong>, but some genera, most notably <i>Ailanthus</i>, extend well into temperate regions of Asia and are now widely naturalized elsewhere. A defining characteristic of the family is the presence of extremely bitter triterpenoid compounds called <strong>quassinoids</strong> in the bark, wood, and leaves of most species. These compounds contribute to the historical use of some species (like <i>Quassia amara</i>) in traditional medicine and as insecticides, and also make the plants unpalatable to many herbivores.</p>
<p>While some species provide timber or have local uses, the family is perhaps best known globally for <i>Ailanthus altissima</i> (Tree-of-heaven), a fast-growing tree native to China that has become a highly invasive species in many parts of the world due to its rapid growth, prolific seed production (samaras), and allelopathic properties.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Members are predominantly <strong>trees or shrubs</strong>, ranging from small shrubs to large forest trees. They can be deciduous or evergreen. A key physiological feature is the common presence of intensely <strong>bitter substances (quassinoids)</strong> throughout the plant tissues. Some species, like <i>Ailanthus</i>, have a strong, unpleasant odor when leaves or twigs are crushed.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually arranged <strong>alternately</strong> along the stem (rarely opposite). They are typically <strong>pinnately compound</strong>, often large, although simple, trifoliolate, or bipinnate leaves occur in some genera. Leaflets commonly have entire margins, but sometimes possess characteristic glandular teeth near the base. Stipules are absent (<strong>exstipulate</strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Flowers are typically borne in axillary or terminal inflorescences, which are often large, branched <strong>panicles</strong>, though cymes or racemes also occur.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are generally small, inconspicuous, radially symmetrical (actinomorphic), and most often <strong>unisexual</strong> (plants being dioecious, monoecious, or polygamous), although bisexual flowers occur in some. Key floral features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Usually 3-5 (rarely up to 8) small sepals, which may be distinct or fused at the base.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Usually 3-5 (rarely up to 8) distinct (free) petals, often small, sometimes absent.</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens usually equal in number to the petals or, more commonly, twice the number of petals (typically 5 or 10 total). Filaments are distinct, often bearing a small scale-like appendage at the base. Stamens arise from the base or outside of the nectar disc.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium (in female/bisexual flowers):</strong> Composed of <strong>2-5(-8) carpels</strong>. These carpels may be entirely <strong>free (apocarpous)</strong> except perhaps for fused styles, or they may be <strong>fused only at the base (syncarpous basally)</strong> while remaining distinct above. The ovary is positioned <strong>superiorly</strong>. Each carpel or ovary locule typically contains a single (rarely two) ovule. Styles may be free or fused.</li>
<li><strong>Nectar Disc:</strong> A nectar-producing disc is usually present within or surrounding the base of the stamens (intrastaminal).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit type is variable and reflects the gynoecium structure. Often, it is an aggregate of separate, one-seeded fruitlets developing from the free or basally fused carpels. Common fruit types include winged achenes (<strong>samaras</strong>), as seen in <i>Ailanthus</i>, or fleshy <strong>drupes</strong>, as in <i>Simarouba</i> and <i>Picrasma</i>. Less commonly, fruits can be berries or capsules (if carpels are more fully fused). Seeds often contain oil; endosperm may be present or absent.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>The family is chemically defined by the presence of complex triterpenoid compounds known as <strong>quassinoids</strong>. These are responsible for the extreme bitterness found in many species and have various biological activities (insecticidal, antimalarial, etc.).</p>

<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying members of <i>Simaroubaceae</i> often involves recognizing their tree/shrub habit combined with compound leaves and characteristic fruits, along with the often bitter taste:</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Look for <strong>trees or shrubs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Usually <strong>alternate, pinnately compound</strong> (check for terminal leaflet), and <strong>exstipulate</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Taste/Smell:</strong> Bark or leaves often have an intensely <strong>bitter taste</strong> (use caution!). <i>Ailanthus</i> leaves/twigs have a characteristic unpleasant odor (often likened to burnt peanut butter) when crushed.</li>
<li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Generally small, radially symmetric, often unisexual, typically borne in large <strong>panicles</strong>. Look for 3-5 sepals, 3-5 free petals, and usually 5 or 10 stamens.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium/Ovary:</strong> Ovary is <strong>superior</strong>; look closely to see if carpels appear separate or only basally fused (may look like multiple small pistils clustered together).</li>
<li><strong>Fruit:</strong> Often distinctive aggregates of winged <strong>samaras</strong> (like <i>Ailanthus</i>) or fleshy <strong>drupes</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stamen Base:</strong> Check for small appendages at the base of stamen filaments (may require magnification).</li>
<li><strong>Nectar Disc:</strong> Presence of a disc at the flower base.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Pantropical range, with <i>Ailanthus</i> common in temperate zones (often invasive).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growing Season:</strong> Compound leaves are a key feature.</li>
<li><strong>Flowering:</strong> Large panicles of small flowers can be noticeable, though individual flowers are inconspicuous.</li>
<li><strong>Fruiting:</strong> The aggregate fruits, especially the winged samaras of <i>Ailanthus</i> (often reddish when maturing) or the drupes of other genera, are often very characteristic in late summer or fall.</li>
<li><strong>Year-round:</strong> Bitter taste of bark/twigs (use caution). Woody habit.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><i>Anacardiaceae</i> (Sumac family):</strong> Also Sapindales, often compound leaves. Differ in often having resin canals (sometimes causing rash), usually single drupe fruits, and different floral details.</li>
<li><strong><i>Rutaceae</i> (Citrus family):</strong> Also Sapindales, often compound leaves. Distinguished by aromatic oil glands (pellucid dots) in leaves and often very different fruit types (hesperidium, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><i>Meliaceae</i> (Mahogany family):</strong> Also Sapindales, usually compound leaves. Distinguished by typically having stamens fused into a tube and different fruit types (often capsules).</li>
<li><strong><i>Fabaceae</i> (Legume family):</strong> Many trees/shrubs with compound leaves. Distinguished by having stipules, characteristic legume fruit pods, and often specialized flower types (e.g., pea-like).</li>
<li><strong><i>Juglandaceae</i> (Walnut family):</strong> Trees with compound leaves. Differ in being wind-pollinated (catkins), having inferior ovaries, and fruit being a nut (often in a husk).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p><i>Simaroubaceae</i> is a family within the large order <strong><i>Sapindales</i></strong>, which is part of the Malvid clade within the Rosids. This order includes many economically important families like Sapindaceae (maples, lychee), Rutaceae (citrus), Anacardiaceae (cashew, mango, pistachio), and Meliaceae (mahogany).</p>
<p>The circumscription of <i>Simaroubaceae</i> has fluctuated somewhat historically, with certain genera sometimes segregated into smaller families (e.g., Picramniaceae, Surianaceae, Irvingiaceae, Kirkiaceae). However, molecular phylogenetic studies generally support a core <i>Simaroubaceae</i> (including <i>Ailanthus, Simarouba, Quassia, Picrasma, Brucea</i>, etc.) as a monophyletic group within Sapindales. Its relationships to other families within the order are complex and subject to ongoing research, but it is clearly distinct from families like Rutaceae or Anacardiaceae.</p>
