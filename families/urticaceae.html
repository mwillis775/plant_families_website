<h1>Urticaceae</h1>
<p class="family-common-name">Nettle Family</p>
<p class="family-description">The Urticaceae family, commonly known as the nettle family, is a large and diverse group comprising mostly herbaceous plants, but also including some shrubs, small trees, and lianas. Many members are famous (or infamous) for their stinging hairs (trichomes). Leaves are typically simple and stipulate. Flowers are small, usually unisexual, greenish, and often wind-pollinated, borne in various types of clusters. The fruit is typically an achene. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution but is most diverse in tropical regions.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Urticaceae is a widespread family of about 2600 species in 50-60 genera, found throughout the world but concentrated in the tropics and subtropics. While best known for the stinging nettles (<i>Urtica</i>), the family includes many non-stinging members, some of which are popular houseplants (e.g., <i>Pilea</i>) or economically important fiber plants (e.g., Ramie, <i>Boehmeria nivea</i>).</p>
<p>Plants in this family often thrive in moist, shaded, nutrient-rich environments. The stinging hairs found in many genera serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Flowers are typically small and reduced, consistent with wind pollination, although some species may be insect-pollinated. The family exhibits considerable variation in habit, from small annual herbs to large tropical trees.</p>
<p>Economically, the family provides fibers (Ramie is one of the oldest fiber crops), edible plants (nettle soup, cooked greens), traditional medicines, and ornamental species. Some species can be weedy. Phylogenetically, Urticaceae is part of the "urticalean rosids," closely related to Moraceae, Cannabaceae, and Ulmaceae.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Predominantly annual or perennial herbs, but also includes shrubs, small trees, and lianas. Many species possess specialized stinging hairs (trichomes) on their stems and leaves, which inject irritant chemicals upon contact. However, many genera lack stinging hairs entirely. Stems are often fibrous.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually simple (rarely palmately compound) and arranged oppositely or alternately, often varying within the same plant. Leaf margins are commonly toothed or serrated, sometimes entire. Stipules are typically present, though sometimes fused or falling early. Many species have cystoliths (concretions of calcium carbonate) in their epidermal cells, which may appear as dots or streaks, especially on dried specimens.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Flowers are borne in various types of inflorescences, commonly axillary cymose clusters, which can be open and branched, or condensed into dense heads, spikes, or panicles. Inflorescences are often unisexual.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are small, inconspicuous, typically unisexual (plants monoecious or dioecious), and usually greenish. Pollination is mostly by wind (anemophilous), sometimes by insects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perianth:</strong> Consists of a single whorl of (usually) 4 or 5 sepals (sometimes 3 or fused), often persistent in fruit; petals are absent.</li>
<li><strong>Male Flowers (Staminate):</strong> Usually have 4 or 5 stamens, opposite the sepals. Filaments are typically inflexed in bud and spring outward elastically at maturity, explosively releasing pollen. A rudimentary pistil (pistillode) is often present.</li>
<li><strong>Female Flowers (Pistillate):</strong> Have a superior ovary, typically composed of a single carpel with one basal ovule. The style is usually single with a often brush-like (penicillate) or linear stigma. Staminodes may be present or absent.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The fruit is typically a small, dry, indehiscent achene, often enclosed or subtended by the persistent perianth. Less commonly, the fruit may be fleshy and drupe-like, or the perianth may become fleshy, aiding dispersal. The seed usually contains an oily endosperm and a straight embryo.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>The most notable chemical feature is the presence of irritant compounds in the stinging hairs of many genera. These typically include <strong>formic acid, histamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin</strong>, which cause the characteristic stinging sensation and rash upon contact. Mucilage cells and tannins are also common in the family.</p>

<h2>Field Identification</h2>
<p>Identifying Urticaceae often involves looking for a combination of habitat, habit, leaf arrangement, and, where present, the characteristic stinging hairs.</p>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stinging Hairs:</strong> Presence of stinging hairs on stems and/or leaves (characteristic of many, but not all, genera like <i>Urtica</i>, <i>Laportea</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Habit:</strong> Mostly herbaceous (annual or perennial).</li>
<li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Simple, stipulate, often opposite or alternate with toothed margins.</li>
<li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Small, greenish, unisexual flowers clustered in axillary inflorescences.</li>
<li><strong>Habitat:</strong> Often found in moist, shaded, or disturbed areas with rich soil.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stipules:</strong> Presence, size, and shape can be useful.</li>
<li><strong>Cystoliths:</strong> Visible dots or streaks on dried leaves.</li>
<li><strong>Fibrous Stems:</strong> Stems often contain strong fibers.</li>
<li><strong>Pollen Release:</strong> Explosive pollen release from male flowers (requires close observation or magnification).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spring/Summer/Fall:</strong> Most species flower and fruit during the growing season. Vegetative characteristics (stinging hairs, leaf arrangement) are key identification features throughout this period.</li>
<li><strong>Winter:</strong> Most herbaceous species die back, though basal rosettes or rhizomes may persist. Dried stalks might remain for some species.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<p>Urticaceae members, especially non-stinging ones, can be confused with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lamiaceae (Mint family):</strong> Often have opposite leaves and herbaceous habit, but typically possess square stems, aromatic foliage, and bilabiate (two-lipped) flowers. Lack stinging hairs.</li>
<li><strong>Verbenaceae (Vervain family):</strong> Can have opposite leaves and small flowers in spikes, but flower structure is different (tubular corolla, typically 4 stamens). Lack stinging hairs.</li>
<li><strong>Acanthaceae:</strong> Diverse family, some herbs with opposite leaves, but flowers are usually more conspicuous and bilabiate or tubular. Lack stinging hairs.</li>
<li><strong>Other herbaceous families:</strong> Careful examination of flower structure, fruit type, and presence/absence of stipules and stinging hairs is needed for differentiation.</li>
</ul>
