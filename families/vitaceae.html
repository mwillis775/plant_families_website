<h1>Vitaceae</h1>
<p class="guide-description"> Vitaceae, the grape family, is a family of eudicots comprising the single order Vitales, positioned near the base of the Rosid clade. It includes about 16 genera and nearly 1000 species, consisting mostly of lianas (woody or herbaceous vines) that climb using characteristic <b>tendrils located opposite the leaves</b>. Leaves are typically alternate and often palmately lobed or compound. Flowers are small, usually 4- or 5-merous, often clustered in panicle-like cymes, possessing a superior ovary, and developing into a characteristic <b>berry</b> fruit (the grape).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Grape family has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, being most diverse in tropical and Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. Its paramount economic significance comes from grapes (genus <i>Vitis</i>), particularly cultivars of <i>Vitis vinifera</i>, which are cultivated globally for wine production, fresh fruit (table grapes), raisins, and juice. Grapes represent one of the world's most valuable fruit crops.</p>
<p>Beyond <i>Vitis</i>, the family includes other well-known genera such as <i>Parthenocissus</i> (Virginia creepers, Boston ivy), often grown as ornamental vines for their climbing ability (using tendrils with adhesive discs) and brilliant fall color, and <i>Ampelopsis</i> (peppervines), also containing ornamental and sometimes weedy vines. The genus <i>Leea</i>, sometimes placed in its own family Leeaceae, consists of shrubs or small trees primarily from the Old World tropics, differing from typical Vitaceae in habit and some floral details but now included based on molecular data.</p>
<p>A key feature aiding recognition is the presence of tendrils used for climbing, which are typically located opposite the leaves at the nodes – a position suggesting they may be modified inflorescences or terminal shoots. The small flowers, often greenish, give rise to the familiar berry fruit. Many species contain raphide crystals (calcium oxalate). In Oklahoma (current location as of March 27, 2025), several native species of wild grapes (<i>Vitis</i> spp.), Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</i>), and Peppervine (<i>Ampelopsis arborea</i>) are common vines found in woodlands, thickets, and along fences.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<div class="characteristic-group"> <h3>Growth Form and Habit</h3>
<p>Predominantly lianas (woody or herbaceous vines) climbing by means of tendrils. Some are shrubs or small trees (notably <i>Leea</i>). Stems often have swollen nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Tendrils</h3>
<p>Tendrils are characteristic and typically arise <b>opposite a leaf</b> at the node. They are considered modified shoots or inflorescences. Tendrils can be simple or branched (forked), coiling around supports or, in <i>Parthenocissus</i>, often terminating in adhesive discs that allow climbing on flat surfaces.</p>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram showing tendril opposite leaf in Vitaceae" src="../img/guides/vitaceae-tendril.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Key feature: Tendril located opposite the leaf at the node.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are usually arranged alternately and spirally along the stem. They are simple (but often palmately lobed or veined, like <i>Vitis</i>) or palmately compound (with 3-7 leaflets, e.g., <i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</i>), rarely pinnately compound (<i>Leea</i>). Margins typically toothed or serrated. Stipules are usually present but often small and deciduous.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Inflorescence</h3>
<p>Inflorescences typically appear opposite the leaves (similar position to tendrils, reflecting shared developmental origin). They are usually branched, complex structures, often described as panicles or compound cymes.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Flowers are typically small, numerous, usually bisexual or functionally unisexual (plants then often polygamodioecious or dioecious). Actinomorphic (radially symmetric) and typically 4- or 5-merous.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calyx:</strong> Small, with 4 or 5 minute sepals fused into a small cup or collar, sometimes nearly obsolete.</li>
<li><strong>Corolla:</strong> Typically 4 or 5 distinct (free) petals, usually small and greenish or yellowish. In <i>Vitis</i>, the petals are characteristically coherent (stuck together) at their tips and fall off together as a single cap (<b>calyptra</b>) when the flower opens (anthesis).</li>
<li><strong>Androecium:</strong> Stamens number as many as (usually 4 or 5) and are positioned <b>opposite</b> the petals (a key feature). Filaments are distinct, arising from the base of the ovary or a nectar disc. Anthers open via longitudinal slits.</li>
<li><strong>Gynoecium:</strong> Ovary is <b>superior</b>, composed of typically 2 fused carpels forming 2 locules. Placentation is axile (or appearing basal), with typically 2 ovules per locule. A prominent <b>nectar disc</b> is usually present between the stamens and ovary, often surrounding the ovary base. Style single, usually short and conical; stigma small, capitate or slightly lobed.</li>
</ul>
<div class="guide-illustration">
<img alt="Diagram of Vitaceae flower structure" src="../img/guides/vitaceae-flower.jpg"/> <p class="caption">Generalized Vitaceae flower: Small, 4-5 merous, petals often falling as a cap (<i>Vitis</i>), stamens opposite petals, prominent nectar disc, superior ovary.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Fruits and Seeds</h3>
<p>The characteristic fruit is a <b>berry</b> (specifically, the grape). It develops from the superior ovary and typically contains 1-4 (usually starting with 4 ovules) relatively hard, often pear-shaped seeds. The pulp is fleshy. Seeds contain oily and proteinaceous endosperm and a small embryo.</p>
</div>
<div class="characteristic-group">
<h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3>
<p>Plants often contain tannins, phenolic compounds like resveratrol (notably in grape skins), and organic acids (especially tartaric acid in grapes). Raphide crystals (bundles of needle-like calcium oxalate crystals) are common in tissues. They generally lack the prominent latex, alkaloids, iridoids, or glucosinolates found in some other major orders.</p>

<h2>Identification Basics</h2>
<p>Identifying Vitaceae usually relies on recognizing the vining habit with tendrils opposite the leaves, combined with leaf shape and the berry fruit.</p>
<div class="identification-feature"> <h3>Primary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vining Habit (Mostly):</strong> Lianas climbing with tendrils.</li>
<li><strong>Tendrils Opposite Leaves:</strong> Tendrils arise from the node on the opposite side of the stem from the leaf petiole.</li>
<li><strong>Alternate Leaves:</strong> Simple (often palmately lobed/veined) or palmately compound leaves arranged alternately.</li>
<li><strong>Small 4- or 5-merous Flowers:</strong> Often in panicle/cyme-like clusters opposite leaves.</li>
<li><strong>Stamens Opposite Petals:</strong> Usually 4 or 5 stamens positioned opposite the petals.</li>
<li><strong>Superior Ovary:</strong> With prominent nectar disc at base.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit a Berry (Grape):</strong> Fleshy fruit containing 1-4 hard seeds.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Secondary Identification Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Petals Falling as a Cap:</strong> Coherent petals shed together (<i>Vitis</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Tendril Tips:</strong> Simple coiling vs. branched vs. adhesive discs (<i>Parthenocissus</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Leaf Shape:</strong> Simple/lobed (<i>Vitis</i>, <i>Ampelopsis</i>) vs. Palmately compound (<i>Parthenocissus</i>).</li>
<li><strong>Woody vs. Herbaceous Vine:</strong> Most are woody.</li>
<li><strong>Presence of Raphides:</strong> Can cause mild irritation if handled extensively.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Seasonal Identification Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growing Season:</strong> Alternate leaves and opposite tendrils are key vegetative features. Flowers appear late spring/early summer.</li>
<li><strong>Late Summer/Fall:</strong> Berries (grapes) mature and are highly characteristic. Fall color can be spectacular, especially the bright reds of <i>Parthenocissus</i>.</li>
<li><strong>Winter:</strong> Woody vines are visible; tendril position opposite leaf scars can still be observed. Bud shape and bark may help.</li>
<li>(Oklahoma Context: Native <i>Vitis</i>, <i>Parthenocissus</i>, and <i>Ampelopsis</i> vines are common in woodlands, thickets, and fencerows. Their leaves, tendrils, and fruits are readily observable during appropriate seasons).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="identification-feature">
<h3>Common Confusion Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cucurbitaceae (Gourd Family):</strong> Herbaceous vines with tendrils and alternate palmate leaves. Key differences: Tendrils arise laterally at node (not opposite leaf); flowers usually unisexual, large, yellow/orange; ovary inferior; fruit a pepo.</li>
<li><strong>Passifloraceae (Passion Flower Family):</strong> Vines with tendrils and alternate lobed leaves. Key differences: Tendrils usually axillary (not opposite leaf); flowers highly complex with corona; ovary superior but often stalked; fruit a berry or capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Convolvulaceae (Morning Glory Family):</strong> Herbaceous vines with alternate leaves (often heart-shaped). Key differences: Lack tendrils (twine with stems); flowers bisexual, funnel-shaped, superior ovary; fruit a capsule.</li>
<li><strong>Menispermaceae (Moonseed family):</strong> Woody vines, alternate simple leaves (often lobed). Key differences: Lack tendrils; flowers small, unisexual, usually 6-merous; fruit a drupe with crescent-shaped seed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The position of the <strong>tendrils opposite the leaves</strong> is the most distinctive and reliable field mark for identifying Vitaceae.</p>

<h2>Phylogeny and Classification</h2>
<p>Vitaceae holds a unique phylogenetic position. It is the sole family in the order <strong>Vitales</strong>, which molecular data places as the <strong>sister group to all other <em>Rosids</em></strong> (<em>Fabids</em> + <em>Malvids</em>). This means Vitaceae represents an early diverging lineage within the vast <em>Rosid</em> clade, branching off before the diversification of major orders like Rosales, Fabales, Malvales, Myrtales, etc. This placement highlights its distinct evolutionary history.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the genus <i>Leea</i> (formerly often family Leeaceae) within Vitaceae is supported by APG classifications based on molecular evidence, although <i>Leea</i> differs significantly in its shrubby/tree habit, compound leaves, and lack of tendrils. Within the core vining Vitaceae, relationships between genera like <i>Vitis</i>, <i>Parthenocissus</i>, <i>Ampelopsis</i>, and <i>Cissus</i> have been clarified by molecular studies. Key evolutionary features include the development of the tendril opposite the leaf (a defining trait), the characteristic floral structure with stamens opposite petals, and the berry fruit type, which facilitated dispersal by animals and ultimately human cultivation.</p>

<li>(Vitales is sister to all other <em>Rosids</em>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="related-families"> <h3>Related Groups (<em>Rosids</em>)</h3>
<p>As the sole family in Vitales, Vitaceae's closest relatives are the entirety of the remaining <em>Rosid</em> clade. It represents the sister lineage to this huge group, which includes orders like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Fabids</em> Clade (Eurosids I):</strong> Includes orders Fabales (Pea family), Rosales (Rose family), Fagales (Oak family), Cucurbitales (Gourd family), Malpighiales (Spurge/Willow families), etc.</li>
<li><strong><em>Malvids</em> Clade (Eurosids II):</strong> Includes orders Malvales (Mallow family), Brassicales (Mustard family), Sapindales (Maple/Citrus families), Myrtales (Myrtle family), etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="evolutionary-significance"> <h3>Evolutionary Significance</h3>
<p>Vitaceae is crucial for understanding the early evolution and diversification of the massive <em>Rosid</em> clade. Its position as sister to all other <em>Rosids</em> makes it a key reference point for studying ancestral traits and evolutionary transitions within this major eudicot lineage. The evolution of the highly successful vining habit, coupled with the unique tendril position (opposite the leaf), represents a significant morphological innovation. The characteristic floral structure with stamens opposite the petals is also noteworthy. Furthermore, the long history of human cultivation and selection, especially within <em>Vitis vinifera</em>, provides a powerful model for studying domestication and artificial selection.</p>
