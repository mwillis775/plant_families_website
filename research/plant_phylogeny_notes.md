# Plant Phylogeny Research Notes

## APG IV Classification System

The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group IV (APG IV) system is the fourth version of a modern, molecular-based system of plant taxonomy. Published in 2016, it represents the current scientific consensus on the evolutionary relationships between flowering plants (angiosperms).

### Key Points about APG IV:
- Based on molecular evidence and phylogenetic studies
- Focuses on orders and families of flowering plants
- Represents relationships within orders of all families of seed plants
- Accepted in "The Plant Book" (Mabberley 2017)

### Major Plant Groups in Phylogenetic Order:

#### Non-Flowering Plants
1. **Bryophytes s.l.** (non-vascular plants)
2. **Pteridophytes** (ferns and allies)

#### Seed Plants (Spermatophytes)
1. **Gymnosperms**:
   - Cycadales: [Cycadaceae + Zamiaceae]
   - Ginkgoales: Ginkgoaceae
   - Cupressales: [[Araucariaceae + Podocarpaceae] [Sciadopityaceae [Taxaceae + Cupressaceae]]]
   - Pinales: Pinaceae
   - Gnetales: [Ephedraceae [Gnetaceae + Welwitschiaceae]]

2. **Angiosperms/Flowering Plants**:
   - Major changes since 2016 include:
     - Brassicales: added Tiganophytaceae
     - Santalales: added Mystropetalaceae
     - Core Asterids/gentianids: added Oncothecales (Oncothecaceae)
     - Lamiales: added Wightiaceae
     - CAMPANULID/ASTERID II: Added Cardiopteridales [Cardiopteridaceae + Stemonuraceae]
     - Added Desfontainiales: Columelliaceae

### Notes on Classification Structure:
- Square brackets [...] enclose clades
- The plus sign + designates terminal sister taxa
- A comma , denotes part of a polytomy
- Relationships along the spine of the Pentapetalae and within orders like Malpighiales are subject to change

## Importance for Website Development:
- Need to organize plant families according to this phylogenetic order
- Should include both flowering and non-flowering plants
- Must highlight recent changes in classification
- Should explain the evolutionary relationships between major plant groups
- Need to emphasize that classification is ongoing and subject to updates

## Next Steps:
- Research specific characteristics of each major plant family
- Gather identification features for field recognition
- Compile examples of common plants in each family
- Research visual markers for family identification
